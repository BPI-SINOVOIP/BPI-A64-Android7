Description:
Hyphenation patterns for automatic hyphenation for German.

Local Modifications:
The patterns were first generated by running make after cloning the upstream
git repo.

The resulting files have been split and renamed to follow the same style as
other hyphenation patterns.

The *.chr.txt has been automatically generated based on the contents of the
pattern files, using the create_chr.py script that we created ourselves.
