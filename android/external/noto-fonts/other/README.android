Description:
Noto fonts, for supporting several languages and scripts.

Local Modifications:
This directory tracks the upstream result of running 'make android',
which compresses the unhinted fonts (and in case of Malayalam and
Tamil UI fonts, scales the fonts down by 90%). It does not include any
of the tools.

We also include two subsetted copies of NotoSansSymbols, which are
built into different font profiles.

Not all the files are included in the Android build.
