"""Checks if a virtual webcam is running and starts it if not.

Returns a non-zero return code if the webcam could not be started.

Prerequisites:
* The Python interpreter must have the psutil package installed.
* Windows: a scheduled task named 'ManyCam' must exist and be configured to
  launch ManyCam preconfigured to auto-play the test clip.
* Mac: ManyCam must be installed in the default location and be preconfigured
  to auto-play the test clip.
* Linux: The v4l2loopback kernel module must be compiled and loaded to the
  kernel already and the v4l2_file_player application must be compiled and put
  in the location specified below.

NOTICE: When running this script as a buildbot step, make sure to set
usePTY=False for the build step when adding it, or the subprocess will die as
soon the step has executed.
