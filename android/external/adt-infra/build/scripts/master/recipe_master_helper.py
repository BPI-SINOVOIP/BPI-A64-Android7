  """Adds schedulers and triggers to the BuildmasterConfig based on
  the the slave_list.

  This function relies on certain structure in the slave_list, in
  particular the custom 'triggered_by' property, which is not yet
  commonly used to define triggers.

  Returns a dictionary mapping builder name, for those builders which
  invoke triggers, to the (synthesized) name of the trigger.

  TODO(kbr): this function does not yet support builders with
  multiple slaves behind them, but could be updated to do so.

  Throws an Exception if a non-existent builder is mentioned in
  another builder's 'triggered_by' property.

  Arguments:

    buildmaster_config: a BuildmasterConfig into which the
      'schedulers' property will be defined.

    slave_list: a SlavesList constructed from slaves.cfg or builders.pyl.

    scheduler_name: the name of the Scheduler for the polling (not
      triggered) builders.
