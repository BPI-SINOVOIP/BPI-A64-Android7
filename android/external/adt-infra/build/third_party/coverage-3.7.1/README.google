Description:
Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution.


Local Modifications:
 * Removed unit tests from current distribution.
 * Updated coverage.egg-info
 * Added .gitignore
 * Modified setup.py to bail if the extension is not compilable, instead of
   automatically building an egg without it.
 * Remove auto-generated coverage.egg-info folder
