Description: 
        The BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required by
        most software projects to validate code changes. By automatically
        rebuilding and testing the tree each time something has changed, build
        problems are pinpointed quickly, before other developers are
        inconvenienced by the failure. The guilty developer can be identified
        and harassed without human intervention. By running the builds on a
        variety of platforms, developers who do not have the facilities to test
        their changes everywhere before checkin will at least know shortly
        afterwards whether they have broken the build or not. Warning counts,
        lint checks, image size, compile time, and other build parameters can
        be tracked over time, are more visible, and are therefore easier to
        improve.
