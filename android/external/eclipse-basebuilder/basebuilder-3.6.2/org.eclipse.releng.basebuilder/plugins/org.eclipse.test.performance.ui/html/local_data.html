<h1>Local data</h1>
<p>
As the connection to the server database is too slow, local files containing
all necessary information are written while generating performance results on
the server.
</p><p>
The performance results tool then can read these files to avoid long distance
access to data information. Of course, it's first necessary to copy these files
on a location easily accessible from the machine where the tool is launched.
</p><p>
<i>Notes
<ul>
<li>these files are accessible for some authorized users onto
<b>ottcvs1.ottawa.ibm.com</b> at <b>/home/users/ecperf</b> directory</li>
<li>SFTP is necessary to copy these files from that location</li>
</ul>
</i>
</p><p>
To read the local files, select the <b>Local data -> Read...</b> menu item and
chose the directory where the files have been copied.
</p><p>
<i>Notes
<ul>
<li>this manual read action only has to be done once, as it will be automatically
done at the next start of the tool</li>
<li>no verification is currently done that the local files matches
the connected DB (if any). Mixing them should give unpredictable results!</li>
</ul>
