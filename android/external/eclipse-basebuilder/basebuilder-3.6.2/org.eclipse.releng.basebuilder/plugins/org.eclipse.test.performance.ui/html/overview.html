<h1>Overview</h1>
The performance results tool provide an easy way to look at results collected
while running performance tests on a build. It is accessible using the <b>Performance Results</b>
perspective:
<p><img src="images/perspective.png" alt="Performance Results perspective"/></p>
<p>
There are 4 views in this perspective:
<ul>
<li><a href="components.html">Components view</a>: This is the view to see
the results in details for each components</li>
<li><a href="builds.html">Builds view</a>: This is the view to see all builds,
update local data and generate results when necessary</li>
<li><a href="results.html">Components Results view</a>: This is the view to
see whole results for each machine in a single table</li>
<li><a href="properties.html">Properties view</a>: Display element properties
(typically results numbers and other database information)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The goal of this tool is both to look at performance results database numbers
and to verify whether a build result may have scenario showing performance regression.
</p><p>
The view to use to look at performance results number is the <a href="components.html">Components view</a>.
In this results are displayed in a hierarchical tree which have a similar structure
than the generated HTML pages (e.g.
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.5-200906111540/performance/performance.php">Eclipse 3.5.0</a>).
The complete performance results information is provided on each element of the tree in the
<a href="properties.html">Properties view</a>. This is typically useful when a scenario
results looks weird to have the ability to verify that the numbers looks correct
or not.
</p><p>
The view to verify whether a regression occurs is the <a href="results.html">Components Results view</a>.
All results for one component are shown in a single table which also provides
all necessary information to decide whether a noticed regression could be confirmed
or not.
