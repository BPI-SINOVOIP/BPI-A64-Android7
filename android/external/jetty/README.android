Description
-------------------
Jetty is a lightweight, servlet container implementation in Java.

The pom.xml_saved file is included as a reference for bringing down the complete, original source
code and dependencies using maven. Note, the file structure generated with pom.xml_saved will
not match the current file structure, as noted in the Local Modifcations section. Furthermore, not
all of the original sources are compatible with the android runtime. Incompatible source files are
listed in the Android.mk file under "NON_ANDROID_SRC" and the build.gradle file under nonAndroidSrc.

Local Modifcations
-------------------
The complete original source code was downloaded using pom.xml_saved. The pom file creates a
separate directory for each jetty package. the src directory of the relevant packages were merged
into a single src directory. The relevant packages which were merged into the single src directory
are:

-jetty-client
-jetty-continuation
-jetty-http
-jetty-io
-jetty-security
-jetty-server
-jetty-servlet
-jetty-servlets
-jetty-util
-jetty-webapp
-jetty-websocket
-jetty-xml

All other packages were discarded. Prebuilt dependencies (SLF4J, the servlet api and jetty utils)
were copied from the maven repository into the lib directory. pom files and sha1 files are included
with the prebuilt dependencies for reference.

The eclipse files were created manually. The .classpath file includes the prebuilt dependencies in
the lib directory and excludes the source files that are not compatible with the android runtime
(see "NON_ANDROID_SRC" in the Android.mk file or nonAndroidSrc in the build.gradle file). The
.project file was copied from one of the .project files created by maven.

Updating this Project
-------------------
To update this project, the updated packages should be fetched from maven and their src directories
should be merged with the local src directory. Any new or updated prebuilt dependencies should be
copied into the lib directory. The Android.mk file (.classpath file for eclipse) should be updated
accordingly. It may be necessary to add more files to "NON_ANDROID_SRC" in the Android.mk file and
nonAndroidSrc in the build.gradle file (the excluding element in .classpath for eclipse).
