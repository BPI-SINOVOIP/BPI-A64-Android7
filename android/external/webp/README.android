Local modifications:
- Rewrite Android.mk to remove duplicate definitions and set module name
  in a consistent way with other external libraries
- Copy public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Removed build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.mk
- Added a local copy of cpu-features.[hc] to src/dsp
- Removed WEBP_ANDROID_NEON check in dsp.h to avoid breaking non-NEON builds
  where the flags in Android.mk are not set correctly currently.
- Marked variable "status" in WebPParseHeaders as volatile to work around

The Android.mk file creates WebP decoder and encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by adding to LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
libwebp-decode libwebp-encode:

  LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += libwebp-decode libwebp-encode
