# droiddriver-android_support_test

An optional library that integrates DroidDriver with [the Android Support Test Library](https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/wiki/AndroidJUnitRunnerUserGuide).
This is an experimental library because the Android Support Test Library is at early stage and many
APIs are in internal packages.
