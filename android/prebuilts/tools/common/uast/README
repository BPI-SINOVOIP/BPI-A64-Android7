This library is a subset of IntelliJ IDEA's PSI API, extracted
via the psi extration tool in tools/base/misc/psi-extractor/.

This jar is extracted into the tools/base/lint/libs/uast
library, which is a Java library packaged along with the
rest of the tools libraries such that they can be published
and signed using Gradle's machinery.
