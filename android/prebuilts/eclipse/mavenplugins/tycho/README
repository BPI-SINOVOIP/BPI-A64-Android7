Building the ADT Bundle [1] and the monitor RCP application [2] require
the use of Tycho [3], which is a Maven plugin. This folder contains
a mirror of the Maven Central repository that contains the Tycho
maven plugin and all of its dependencies. This allows the build server
to run Maven in offline mode.
