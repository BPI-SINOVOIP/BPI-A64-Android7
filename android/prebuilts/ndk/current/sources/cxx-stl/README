NOTE:

EH/ contains gabi++ and stlport in NDK r9* with exception handling support.
Unfortunatley by adding EH the new stlport breaks the compatibility with the
platform's stlport, meaning that code links with the new one can't be later
used to link with platform's stlport, and vice versa.

So, we symlink gabi++ and stlport back to 8/ (which stays at r8c) for now,
until all inconsistency are fixed and all [vendor] binaries are compiled
with the new stlport.
