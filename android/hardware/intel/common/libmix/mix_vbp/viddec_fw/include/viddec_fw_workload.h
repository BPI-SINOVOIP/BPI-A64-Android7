                  Currently, its valid only for MPEG2.
                  For other codecs, it defaults to 0.

    range_adjusted_out:	Frame buffer needed to store range adjusted frames for VC1 only.
                        Range adjustment in VC1 requires that the luma/chroma values in the decoded frame be modified
                        before the frame can be displayed. In this case, we need a new frame buffer to store he adjusted values.
                        The parser will indicate this requirement by setting the WORKLOAD_FLAGS_RA_FRAME bit in the 
                        is_reference_frame of the workload. The decoder expects this field to be valid when range adjustment
                        is indicated and populates this frame buffer along with frame_out.

    Expectation from user:
                        Before feeding workload to the decoder, do the following:
                           If pip is indicated/needed, 
                              provide the pip_out buffer
                           If range adjustment is indicated (WORKLOAD_FLAGS_RA_FRAME bit in is_reference_frame is set), 
                              provide range_adjusted_out buffer
                           Provide frame_out buffer.

                        After workload is returned from the decoder, do the following:
                           If pip is indicated, 
                              display the pip_out buffer
                           Else If range adjustment is indicated, 
                              display range_adjusted_out buffer
                           Else 
                              display frame_out buffer.
