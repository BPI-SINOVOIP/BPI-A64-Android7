 * This function is used to initiate HW accelerated decoding of encoded data buffers.  This function may be used in two major modes, direct-render or decode-return.  
 *
 * With direct-render, input buffers are provided by the caller which hold encoded audio data, and no output buffers are provided.  The encoded data is decoded, and the decoded data is sent directly to the output speaker.  This allows very low power audio rendering and is the best choice of operation for longer battery life.
 *
 * <note>
 * <title>Intel Audio Manager Support</title>
 * However, if the user has connected a different target output device, such as Bluetooth headphones, this mode cannot be used as the decoded audio must be directed to the Pulse Audio stack where the output to Bluetooth device can be supported, per Intel Audio Manager guidelines.  This mode is called decode-return, and requires the caller to provide output buffers for the decoded data.
 * </note>
 * 
 * Input buffers in both modes are one or more user space buffers using a scatter/gather style vector interface.
 *
 * Output buffers for the decode-return mode are one or more user space buffers in a scatter style vector interface.  Buffers will be filled in order and lengths of data filled will be returned.
 *
 * This call will block until data has been completely copied or queued to the driver.  All user space buffers may be used or released when this call returns.

 * Note: If the stream is configured as #MIX_DECODE_DIRECTRENDER, and whenever the stream in #MIX_STREAM_STOPPED state, the call to mix_audio_decode() will not start the playback until mix_audio_start() is called. This behavior would allow application to queue up data but delay the playback until appropriate time.
