This sample demonstrates how to create watch faces for android wear and includes a phone app
and a wearable app. The wearable app has a variety of watch faces including analog, digital,
opengl, calendar, steps, interactive, etc. It also includes a watch-side configuration example.
The phone app includes a phone-side configuration example.

Additional note on Steps WatchFace Sample, if the user has not installed or setup the Google Fit app
on their phone and their Wear device has not configured the Google Fit Wear App, then you may get
zero steps until one of the two is setup. Please note, many Wear devices configure the Google Fit
Wear App beforehand.
