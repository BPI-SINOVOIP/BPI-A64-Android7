Android MediaBrowserService Sample
===================================

This sample shows how to implement an audio media app that provides
media library metadata and playback controls through a standard
service. It exposes a simple music library through the new
MediaBrowserService and provides MediaSession callbacks. This allows
it to be used in Android Auto, for example.
When not connected to a car, the app has a very simple UI that browses
the media library and provides simple playback controls. When
connected to Android Auto, the same service provides data and callback
to the Android Auto UI in the same manner as it provides them to the
local UI.

Introduction
------------

To implement a MediaBrowserService, you need to:

- Extend android.service.media.MediaBrowserService, implementing the media
  browsing related methods onGetRoot and onLoadChildren;

- In onCreate, start a new MediaSession and call super.setSessionToken() with
  this MediaSession's token;

- Set a MediaSession.Callback class on the MediaSession. The callback class
  will receive all the user's actions, like play, pause, etc;

- Handle all the actual music playing using any method your app prefers
  (for example, the Android MediaPlayer class)

- Whenever it changes, update info about the playing item and the playing
  queue using MediaSession corresponding methods (setMetadata,
  setPlaybackState, setQueue, setQueueTitle, etc)

- Handle AudioManager focus change events and react appropriately
  (e.g. pause when audio focus is lost)


To make it compatible with Android Auto, you also need to:

- Declare a meta-data tag in AndroidManifest.xml linking to a xml resource
  with a automotiveApp root element. For a media app, this must include
  an &lt;uses name="media"/&gt; element as a child.

  For example, in AndroidManifest.xml:
```
     <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.car.application"
       android:resource="@xml/automotive_app_desc"/>
```

  And in res/xml/automotive\_app\_desc.xml:
```
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <automotiveApp>
          <uses name="media"/>
      </automotiveApp>
```

- Declare and export the service in AndroidManifest.xml:
```
    <service
        android:name=".service.MusicService"
        android:exported="true">
      <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
```
