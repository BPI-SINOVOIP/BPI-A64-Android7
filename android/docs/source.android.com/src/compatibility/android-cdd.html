<h1 id="1_introduction">1. Introduction</h1>


<p>This document enumerates the requirements that must be met in order for
devices to be compatible with Android ANDROID_VERSION.</p>

<p>The use of &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;, &ldquo;MUST NOT&rdquo;,
&ldquo;REQUIRED&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL NOT&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHOULD NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo;,
&ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, and &ldquo;OPTIONAL&rdquo; is per the IETF standard
defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>.</p>

<p>As used in this document, a &ldquo;device implementer&rdquo; or
&ldquo;implementer&rdquo; is a person or organization developing a
hardware/software solution running Android ANDROID_VERSION. A &ldquo;device
implementation&rdquo; or &ldquo;implementation is the hardware/software solution
so developed.</p>

<p>To be considered compatible with Android ANDROID_VERSION, device
implementations MUST meet the requirements presented in this Compatibility
Definition, including any documents incorporated via reference.</p>

<p>Where this definition or the software tests described in
<a href="#10_software_compatibility_testing">section 10</a> is silent,
ambiguous, or incomplete, it is the responsibility of the device
implementer to ensure compatibility with existing implementations.</p>

<p>For this reason, the <a href="http://source.android.com/">Android Open Source
Project</a> is both the reference and preferred implementation of Android.
Device implementers are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to base their implementations to
the greatest extent possible on the &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; source code available
from the Android Open Source Project. While some components can hypothetically
be replaced with alternate implementations, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not
follow this practice, as passing the software tests will become substantially
more difficult. It is the implementer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure full
behavioral compatibility with the standard Android implementation, including and
beyond the Compatibility Test Suite. Finally, note that certain component
substitutions and modifications are explicitly forbidden by this document.</p>

<p>Many of the resources linked to in this document are derived directly or
indirectly from the Android SDK and will be functionally identical to the
information in that SDK&rsquo;s documentation. In any cases where this
Compatibility Definition or the Compatibility Test Suite disagrees with the
SDK documentation, the SDK documentation is considered authoritative. Any
technical details provided in the linked resources throughout this document are
considered by inclusion to be part of this Compatibility Definition.</p>

<h1 id="2_device_types">2. Device Types</h1>


<p>While the Android Open Source Project has been used in the implementation of
a variety of device types and form factors, many aspects of the architecture and
compatibility requirements were optimized for handheld devices. Starting from
Android 5.0, the Android Open Source Project aims to embrace a wider variety of
device types as described in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Android Handheld device</strong> refers to an Android device
implementation that is typically used by holding it in the hand, such as mp3
players, phones, and tablets. Android Handheld device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST have a touchscreen embedded in the device.</li>
  <li>MUST have a power source that provides mobility, such as a battery.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Android Television device</strong> refers to an Android device
implementation that is an entertainment interface for consuming digital media,
movies, games, apps, and/or live TV for users sitting about ten feet away (a
&ldquo;lean back&rdquo; or &ldquo;10-foot user interface&rdquo;). Android
Television devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST have an embedded screen OR include a video output port, such as VGA,
  HDMI, or a wireless port for display.</li>
  <li>MUST declare the features
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#FEATURE_LEANBACK">android.software.leanback</a>
  and android.hardware.type.television.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Android Watch device</strong> refers to an Android device
implementation intended to be worn on the body, perhaps on the wrist, and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST have a screen with the physical diagonal length in the range from
  1.1 to 2.5 inches.</li>
  <li>MUST declare the feature android.hardware.type.watch.</li>
  <li>MUST support uiMode =
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH">UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Android Automotive implementation</strong> refers to a vehicle head
unit running Android as an operating system for part or all of the system and/or
infotainment functionality. Android Automotive implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST declare the feature android.hardware.type.automotive.</li>
  <li>MUST support uiMode =
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#UI_MODE_TYPE_CAR">UI_MODE_TYPE_CAR</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All Android device implementations that do not fit into any of the above
device types still MUST meet all requirements in this document to be Android
ANDROID_VERSION compatible, unless the requirement is explicitly described to be
only applicable to a specific Android device type from above.</p>

<h2 id="3_1_managed_api_compatibility">3.1. Managed API Compatibility</h2>


<p>The managed Dalvik bytecode execution environment is the primary vehicle for
Android applications. The Android application programming interface (API) is
the set of Android platform interfaces exposed to applications running in the
managed runtime environment. Device implementations MUST provide complete
implementations, including all documented behaviors, of any documented API
exposed by the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html">Android SDK</a>
or any API decorated with the &ldquo;@SystemApi&rdquo; marker in the upstream
Android source code.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST NOT omit any managed APIs, alter API interfaces
or signatures, deviate from the documented behavior, or include no-ops, except
where specifically allowed by this Compatibility Definition.</p>

<p>This Compatibility Definition permits some types of hardware for which
Android includes APIs to be omitted by device implementations. In such cases,
the APIs MUST still be present and behave in a reasonable way. See
<a href="#7_hardware_compatibility">section 7</a> for specific requirements for
this scenario.</p>

<h2 id="3_2_soft_api_compatibility">3.2. Soft API Compatibility</h2>


<p>In addition to the managed APIs from
<a href="#3_1_managed_api_compatibility">section 3.1</a>, Android also includes
a significant runtime-only &ldquo;soft&rdquo; API, in the form of such things as
intents, permissions, and similar aspects of Android applications that cannot be
enforced at application compile time.</p>

<h3 id="3_2_1_permissions">3.2.1. Permissions</h3>


<p>Device implementers MUST support and enforce all permission constants as
documented by the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html">Permission
reference page</a>. Note that <a href="#9_security_model_compatibility">section
9</a> lists additional requirements related to the Android security model.</p>

<h3 id="3_2_2_build_parameters">3.2.2. Build Parameters</h3>


<p>The Android APIs include a number of constants on the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html">android.os.Build
class</a> that are intended to describe the current device. To provide
consistent, meaningful values across device implementations, the table below
includes additional restrictions on the formats of these values to which device
implementations MUST conform.</p>

<h3 id="3_2_3_intent_compatibility">3.2.3. Intent Compatibility</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST honor Android&rsquo;s loose-coupling intent
system, as described in the sections below. By &ldquo;honored&rdquo; it is meant
that the device implementer MUST provide an Android Activity or Service that
specifies amatching intent filter that binds to and implements correct behavior
for each specified intent pattern.</p>

<h4 id="3_2_3_1_core_application_intents">3.2.3.1. Core Application Intents</h4>


<p>Android intents allow application components to request functionality from
other Android components. The Android upstream project includes a list of
applications considered core Android applications, which implements several
intent patterns to perform common actions. The core Android applications are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Desk Clock</li>
  <li>Browser</li>
  <li>Calendar</li>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Gallery</li>
  <li>GlobalSearch</li>
  <li>Launcher</li>
  <li>Music</li>
  <li>Settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Device implementations SHOULD include the core Android applications as
appropriate but MUST include a component implementing the same intent patterns
defined by all the &ldquo;public&rdquo; Activity or Service components of these
core Android applications. Note that Activity or Service components are
considered &ldquo;public&rdquo; when the attribute android:exported is absent or
has the value true.</p>

<h4 id="3_2_3_2_intent_resolution">3.2.3.2. Intent Resolution</h4>


<p>As Android is an extensible platform, device implementations MUST allow each
intent pattern referenced in <a href="#3_2_3_1_core_application_intents">section
3.2.3.1</a> to be overridden by third-party applications. The upstream Android
open source implementation allows this by default; device implementers MUST NOT
attach special privileges to system applications' use of these intent patterns,
or prevent third-party applications from binding to and assuming control of
these patterns. This prohibition specifically includes but is not limited to
disabling the &ldquo;Chooser&rdquo; user interface that allows the user to
select between multiple applications that all handle the same intent pattern.
</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST provide a user interface for users to modify the
default activity for intents.</p>

<p>However, device implementations MAY provide default activities for specific
URI patterns (e.g. http://play.google.com) when the default activity provides a
more specific attribute for the data URI. For example, an intent filter pattern
specifying the data URI &ldquo;http://www.android.com&rdquo; is more specific
than the browser's core intent pattern for &ldquo;http://&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Android also includes a mechanism for third-party apps to declare an
authoritative default
<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/app-links">app linking
behavior</a> for certain types of web URI intents. When such authoritative
declarations are defined in an app's intent filter patterns, device
implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST attempt to validate any intent filters by performing the validation
  steps defined in the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links">Digital Asset
  Links specification</a> as implemented by the Package Manager in the upstream
  Android Open Source Project.</li>
  <li>MUST attempt validation of the intent filters during the installation of
  the application and set all successfully validated UIR intent filters as
  default app handlers for their UIRs.</li>
  <li>MAY set specific URI intent filters as default app handlers for their
  URIs, if they are successfully verified but other candidate URI filters fail
  verification. If a device implementation does this, it MUST provide the user
  appropriate per-URI pattern overrides in the settings menu.</li>
  <li>MUST provide the user with per-app App Links controls in Settings as
  follows:
  <ul>
    <li>The user MUST be able to override holistically the default app links
    behavior for an app to be: always open, always ask, or never open, which
    must apply to all candidate URI intent filters equally.</li>
    <li>The user MUST be able to see a list of the candidate URI intent filters.
    </li>
    <li>The device implementation MAY provide the user with the ability to
    override specific candidate URI intent filters that were successfully
    verified, on a per-intent filter basis.</li>
    <li>The device implementation MUST provide users with the ability to view
    and override specific candidate URI intent filters if the device
    implementation lets some candidate URI intent filters succeed verification
    while some others can fail.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3_2_3_3_intent_namespaces">3.2.3.3. Intent Namespaces</h4>


<p>Device implementations MUST NOT include any Android component that honors any
new intent or broadcast intent patterns using an ACTION, CATEGORY, or other key
string in the android.* or com.android.* namespace. Device implementers MUST NOT
include any Android components that honor any new intent or broadcast intent
patterns using an ACTION, CATEGORY, or other key string in a package space
belonging to another organization. Device implementers MUST NOT alter or extend
any of the intent patterns used by the core apps listed in
<a href="#3_2_3_1_core_application_intents">section 3.2.3.1</a>. Device
implementations MAY include intent patterns using namespaces clearly and
obviously associated with their own organization. This prohibition is analogous
to that specified for Java language classes in
<a href="#3_6_api_namespaces">section 3.6</a>.</p>

<h4 id="3_2_3_4_broadcast_intents">3.2.3.4. Broadcast Intents</h4>


<p>Third-party applications rely on the platform to broadcast certain intents to
notify them of changes in the hardware or software environment.
Android-compatible devices MUST broadcast the public broadcast intents in
response to appropriate system events. Broadcast intents are described in the
SDK documentation.</p>

<h4 id="3_2_3_5_default_app_settings">3.2.3.5. Default App Settings</h4>


<p>Android includes settings that provide users an easy way to select their
default applications, for example for Home screen or SMS. Where it makes sense,
device implementations MUST provide a similar settings menu and be compatible
with the intent filter pattern and API methods described in the SDK
documentation as below.</p>

<p>Device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST honor the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_HOME_SETTINGS">android.settings.HOME_SETTINGS</a>
  intent to show a default app settings menu for Home Screen, if the device
  implementation reports android.software.home_screen.</li>
  <li>MUST provide a settings menu that will call the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.Sms.Intents.html">android.provider.Telephony.ACTION_CHANGE_DEFAULT</a>
  intent to show a dialog to change the default SMS application, if the device
  implementation reports android.hardware.telephony.</li>
  <li>MUST honor the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_NFC_PAYMENT_SETTINGS">android.settings.NFC_PAYMENT_SETTINGS</a>
  intent to show a default app settings menu for Tap and Pay, if the device
  implementation reports android.hardware.nfc.hce.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3_3_native_api_compatibility">3.3. Native API Compatibility</h2>


<h3 id="3_3_1_application_binary_interfaces">3.3.1. Application Binary Interfaces</h3>


<p>Managed Dalvik bytecode can call into native code provided in the application
.apk file as an ELF .so file compiled for the appropriate device hardware
architecture. As native code is highly dependent on the underlying processor
technology, Android defines a number of Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) in
the Android NDK. Device implementations MUST be compatible with one or more
defined ABIs, and MUST implement compatibility with the Android NDK, as below.</p>

<p>If a device implementation includes support for an Android ABI, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST include support for code running in the managed environment to call
  into native code, using the standard Java Native Interface (JNI) semantics.</li>
  <li>MUST be source-compatible (i.e. header compatible) and binary-compatible
  (for the ABI) with each required library in the list below.</li>
  <li>MUST support the equivalent 32-bit ABI if any 64-bit ABI is supported.</li>
  <li>MUST accurately report the native Application Binary Interface (ABI)
  supported by the device, via the android.os.Build.SUPPORTED_ABIS,
  android.os.Build.SUPPORTED_32_BIT_ABIS, and
  android.os.Build.SUPPORTED_64_BIT_ABIS parameters, each a comma separated list
  of ABIs ordered from the most to the least preferred one.</li>
  <li>MUST report, via the above parameters, only those ABIs documented and
  described in the latest version of the
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html">Android NDK ABI
  Management documentation</a>, and MUST include support for the
  <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0388f/Beijfcja.html">Advanced
  SIMD</a> (a.k.a. NEON) extension.</li>
  <li>SHOULD be built using the source code and header files available in the
  upstream Android Open Source Project</li>
</ul>

<p>The following native code APIs MUST be available to apps that include native
code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>libc (C library)</li>
  <li>libm (math library)</li>
  <li>Minimal support for C++</li>
  <li>JNI interface</li>
  <li>liblog (Android logging)</li>
  <li>libz (Zlib compression)</li>
  <li>libdl (dynamic linker)</li>
  <li>libGLESv1_CM.so (OpenGL ES 1.x)</li>
  <li>libGLESv2.so (OpenGL ES 2.0)</li>
  <li>libGLESv3.so (OpenGL ES 3.x)</li>
  <li>libEGL.so (native OpenGL surface management)</li>
  <li>libjnigraphics.so</li>
  <li>libOpenSLES.so (OpenSL ES 1.0.1 audio support)</li>
  <li>libOpenMAXAL.so (OpenMAX AL 1.0.1 support)</li>
  <li>libandroid.so (native Android activity support)</li>
  <li>libmediandk.so (native media APIs support)</li>
  <li>Support for OpenGL, as described below</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that future releases of the Android NDK may introduce support for
additional ABIs. If a device implementation is not compatible with an existing
predefined ABI, it MUST NOT report support for any ABIs at all.</p>

<p>Note that device implementations MUST include libGLESv3.so and it MUST symlink
(symbolic link) to libGLESv2.so. in turn, MUST export all the OpenGL ES 3.1 and
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html#aep">Android
Extension Pack</a> function symbols as defined in the NDK release android-21.
Although all the symbols must be present, only the corresponding functions for
OpenGL ES versions and extensions actually supported by the device must be fully
implemented.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST NOT include a native library with the
name libvulkan.so.</p>

<p>Native code compatibility is challenging. For this reason, device
implementers are <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> to use the
implementations of the libraries listed above from the upstream Android Open
Source Project.</p>

<h3 id="3_3_2_32-bit_arm_native_code_compatibility">3.3.2.
32-bit ARM Native Code Compatibility</h3>

<p>The ARMv8 architecture deprecates several CPU operations, including some
operations used in existing native code. On 64-bit ARM devices, the following
deprecated operations MUST remain available to 32-bit native ARM code, either
through native CPU support or through software emulation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SWP and SWPB instructions</li>
  <li>SETEND instruction</li>
  <li>CP15ISB, CP15DSB, and CP15DMB barrier operations</li>
</ul>

<p>Legacy versions of the Android NDK used /proc/cpuinfo to discover CPU
features from 32-bit ARM native code. For compatibility with applications built
using this NDK, devices MUST include the following lines in /proc/cpuinfo when
it is read by 32-bit ARM applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Features: &quot;, followed by a list of any optional ARMv7 CPU
  features supported by the device.</li>
  <li>&quot;CPU architecture: &quot;, followed by an integer describing the
  device's highest supported ARM architecture (e.g., &quot;8&quot; for ARMv8
  devices).</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements only apply when /proc/cpuinfo is read by 32-bit ARM
applications. Devices SHOULD not alter /proc/cpuinfo when read by 64-bit ARM or
non-ARM applications.</p>

<h3 id="3_4_1_webview_compatibility">3.4.1. WebView Compatibility</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>Android Watch devices MAY, but all other device implementations MUST provide
a complete implementation of the android.webkit.Webview API.</p>
</div>


<p>The platform feature android.software.webview MUST be reported on any device

MUST NOT be reported on devices without a complete implementation of the API.
The Android Open Source implementation uses code from the Chromium Project to
implement the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">android.webkit.WebView</a>.
Because it is not feasible to develop a comprehensive test suite for a web
rendering system, device implementers MUST use the specific upstream build of
Chromium in the WebView implementation. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device android.webkit.WebView implementations MUST be based on the
  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> build from the upstream

    <li>The value of the $(CHROMIUM_VER) string MUST be the version of Chromium
    in the upstream Android Open Source Project.</li>
    <li>Device implementations MAY omit Mobile in the user agent string.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The WebView component SHOULD include support for as many HTML5 features as

<p>The standalone Browser MAY be based on a browser technology other than WebKit.
However, even if an alternate Browser application is used, the
android.webkit.WebView component provided to third-party applications MUST be
based on WebKit, as described in <a href="#3_4_1_webview_compatibility">section
3.4.1</a>.</p>

<p>Implementations MAY ship a custom user agent string in the standalone Browser
application.</p>

<p>The standalone Browser application (whether based on the upstream WebKit
Browser application or a third-party replacement) SHOULD include support for as
much of <a href="http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML5</a> as possible.
Minimally, device implementations MUST support each of these APIs associated
with HTML5:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#offline">application
  cache/offline operation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/semantics.html#video">&#60;video&#62;
  tag</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">geolocation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, device implementations MUST support the HTML5/W3C
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">webstorage API</a> and SHOULD support
the HTML5/W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">IndexedDB API</a>. Note
that as the web development standards bodies are transitioning to favor
IndexedDB over webstorage, IndexedDB is expected to become a required component
in a future version of Android.</p>

<h2 id="3_5_api_behavioral_compatibility">3.5. API Behavioral Compatibility</h2>


<p>The behaviors of each of the API types (managed, soft, native, and web) must
be consistent with the preferred implementation of the upstream
<a href="http://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project</a>. Some
specific areas of compatibility are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Devices MUST NOT change the behavior or semantics of a standard intent.
  </li>
  <li>Devices MUST NOT alter the lifecycle or lifecycle semantics of a
  particular type of system component (such as Service, Activity,
  ContentProvider, etc.).</li>
  <li>Devices MUST NOT change the semantics of a standard permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is not comprehensive. The Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) tests
significant portions of the platform for behavioral compatibility, but not all.
It is the responsibility of the implementer to ensure behavioral compatibility
with the Android Open Source Project. For this reason, device implementers
SHOULD use the source code available via the Android Open Source Project where
possible, rather than re-implement significant parts of the system.</p>

<h2 id="3_6_api_namespaces">3.6. API Namespaces</h2>


<p>Android follows the package and class namespace conventions defined by the
Java programming language. To ensure compatibility with third-party
applications, device implementers MUST NOT make any prohibited modifications
(see below) to these package namespaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>java.*</li>
  <li>javax.*</li>
  <li>sun.*</li>
  <li>android.*</li>
  <li>com.android.*</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prohibited modifications include</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device implementations MUST NOT modify the publicly exposed APIs on the
  Android platform by changing any method or class signatures, or by removing
  classes or class fields.</li>
  <li>Device implementers MAY modify the underlying implementation of the APIs,
  but such modifications MUST NOT impact the stated behavior and Java-language
  signature of any publicly exposed APIs.</li>
  <li>Device implementers MUST NOT add any publicly exposed elements (such as
  classes or interfaces, or fields or methods to existing classes or interfaces)
  to the APIs above.</li>
</ul>

<p>A &ldquo;publicly exposed element&rdquo; is any construct that is not
decorated with the&ldquo;@hide&rdquo; marker as used in the upstream Android
source code. In other words, device implementers MUST NOT expose new APIs or
alter existing APIs in the namespaces noted above. Device implementers MAY make
internal-only modifications, but those modifications MUST NOT be advertised or
otherwise exposed to developers.</p>

<p>Device implementers MAY add custom APIs, but any such APIs MUST NOT be in a
namespace owned by or referring to another organization. For instance, device
implementers MUST NOT add APIs to the com.google.* or similar namespace: only
Google may do so. Similarly, Google MUST NOT add APIs to other companies'
namespaces. Additionally, if a device implementation includes custom APIs
outside the standard Android namespace, those APIs MUST be packaged in an
Android shared library so that only apps that explicitly use them (via the
lt;uses-librarygt; mechanism) are affected by the increased memory usage of such
APIs.</p>

<p>If a device implementer proposes to improve one of the package namespaces
above (such as by adding useful new functionality to an existing API, or adding
a new API), the implementer SHOULD visit
<a href="http://source.android.com/">source.android.com</a> and begin the
process for contributing changes and code, according to the information on that
site.</p>

<p>Note that the restrictions above correspond to standard conventions for
naming APIs in the Java programming language; this section simply aims to
reinforce those conventions and make them binding through inclusion in this
Compatibility Definition.</p>

<h2 id="3_7_runtime_compatibility">3.7. Runtime Compatibility</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the full Dalvik Executable (DEX) format
and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/">Dalvik bytecode
specification and semantics</a>. Device implementers SHOULD use ART, the
reference upstream implementation of the Dalvik Executable Format, and the
reference implementation&rsquo;s package management system.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST configure Dalvik runtimes to allocate memory in
accordance with the upstream Android platform, and as specified by the
following table. (See <a href="#7_1_1_screen_configuration">section 7.1.1</a>
for screen size and screen density definitions.) Note that memory values
specified below are considered minimum values and device implementations MAY
allocate more memory per application.</p>

<h2 id="3_8_user_interface_compatibility">3.8. User Interface Compatibility</h2>


<h3 id="3_8_1_launcher_home_screen">3.8.1. Launcher (Home Screen)</h3>


<p>Android includes a launcher application (home screen) and support for
third-party applications to replace the device launcher (home screen). Device
implementations that allow third-party applications to replace the device home
screen MUST declare the platform feature android.software.home_screen.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_2_widgets">3.8.2. Widgets</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>Widgets are optional for all Android device implementations, but SHOULD be
supported on Android Handheld devices.</p>
</div>


<p>Android defines a component type and corresponding API and lifecycle that
allows applications to expose an
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/widget_design.html">&ldquo;AppWidget&rdquo;</a>
to the end user, a feature that is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to be supported on
Handheld Device implementations. Device implementations that support embedding
widgets on the home screen MUST meet the following requirements and declare
support for platform feature android.software.app_widgets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device launchers MUST include built-in support for AppWidgets and expose
  user interface affordances to add, configure, view, and remove AppWidgets
  directly within the Launcher.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST be capable of rendering widgets that are 4 x 4
  in the standard grid size. See the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/widget_design.html">App
  Widget Design Guidelines</a> in the Android SDK documentation for details.
  </li>
  <li>Device implementations that include support for lock screen MAY support
  application widgets on the lock screen.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3_8_3_notifications">3.8.3. Notifications</h3>


<p>Android includes APIs that allow developers to
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html">notify
users of notable events</a> using hardware and software features of the device.</p>

<p>Some APIs allow applications to perform notifications or attract attention
using hardware&#8212;specifically sound, vibration, and light. Device
implementations MUST support notifications that use hardware features, as
described in the SDK documentation, and to the extent possible with the device
implementation hardware. For instance, if a device implementation includes a
vibrator, it MUST correctly implement the vibration APIs. If a device
implementation lacks hardware, the corresponding APIs MUST be implemented as
no-ops. This behavior is further detailed in
<a href="#7_hardware_compatibility">section 7</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the implementation MUST correctly render all
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html">resources</a>
(icons, animation files etc.) provided for in the APIs, or in the Status/System
Bar <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html">icon
style guide</a>, which in the case of an Android Television device includes the
possibility to not display the notifications. Device implementers MAY provide an
alternative user experience for notifications than that provided by the
reference Android Open Source implementation; however, such alternative
notification systems MUST support existing notification resources, as above.</p>

<p>Android includes support for various notifications, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rich notifications</strong>. Interactive Views for ongoing
  notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Heads-up notifications</strong>. Interactive Views users can act
  on or dismiss without leaving the current app.</li>
  <li><strong>Lockscreen notifications</strong>. Notifications shown over a lock
  screen with granular control on visibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Android device implementations, when such notifications are made visible,
MUST properly execute Rich and Heads-up notifications and include the
title/name, icon, text as
<a href="https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/notifications.html">documented
in the Android APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Android includes Notification Listener Service APIs that allow apps (once
explicitly enabled by the user) to receive a copy of all notifications as they
are posted or updated. Device implementations MUST correctly and promptly send
notifications in their entirety to all such installed and user-enabled listener
services, including any and all metadata attached to the Notification object.
</p>

<h3 id="3_8_4_search">3.8.4. Search</h3>


<p>Android includes APIs that allow developers to
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/SearchManager.html">incorporate
search</a> into their applications and expose their application&rsquo;s data
into the global system search. Generally speaking, this functionality consists
of a single, system-wide user interface that allows users to enter queries,
displays suggestions as users type, and displays results. The Android APIs allow
developers to reuse this interface to provide search within their own apps and
allow developers to supply results to the common global search user interface.
</p>

<p>Android device implementations SHOULD include global search, a single,
shared, system-wide search user interface capable of real-time suggestions in
response to user input. Device implementations SHOULD implement the APIs that
allow developers to reuse this user interface to provide search within their own
applications. Device implementations that implement the global search interface
MUST implement the APIs that allow third-party applications to add suggestions
to the search box when it is run in global search mode. If no third-party
applications are installed that make use of this functionality, the default
behavior SHOULD be to display web search engine results and suggestions.</p>

<p>Android device implementations SHOULD implement an assistant on the device
to handle the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_ASSIST">Assist
action</a>.</p>

<p>Android also includes the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/assist/package-summary.html">Assist
APIs</a> to allow applications to elect how much information of the current
context is shared with the assistant on the device. Device implementations
supporting the Assist action MUST indicate clearly to the end user when the the
context is shared by displaying a white light around the edges of the screen. To
ensure clear visibility to the end user, the indication MUST meet or exceed the
duration and brightness of the Android Open Source Project implementation.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_5_toasts">3.8.5. Toasts</h3>


<p>Applications can use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html">&ldquo;Toast&rdquo;
API</a> to display short non-modal strings to the end user that disappear after
a brief period of time. Device implementations MUST display Toasts from
applications to end users in some high-visibility manner.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_6_themes">3.8.6. Themes</h3>


<p>Android provides &ldquo;themes&rdquo; as a mechanism for applications to
apply styles across an entire Activity or application.</p>

<p>Android includes a &ldquo;Holo&rdquo; theme family as a set of defined styles
for application developers to use if they want to match the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html">Holo theme
look and feel</a> as defined by the Android SDK. Device implementations MUST NOT
alter any of the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html">Holo
theme attributes</a> exposed to applications.</p>

<p>Android includes a &ldquo;Material&rdquo; theme family as a set of defined
styles for application developers to use if they want to match the design
theme&rsquo;s look and feel across the wide variety of different Android device
types. Device implementations MUST support the &ldquo;Material&rdquo; theme
family and MUST NOT alter any of the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html#Theme_Material">Material
theme attributes</a> or their assets exposed to applications.</p>

<p>Android also includes a &ldquo;Device Default&rdquo; theme family as a set of
defined styles for application developers to use if they want to match the look
and feel of the device theme as defined by the device implementer. Device
implementations MAY modify the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html">Device
Default theme attributes</a> exposed to applications.</p>

<p>Android supports a variant theme with translucent system bars, which allows
application developers to fill the area behind the status and navigation bar
with their app content. To enable a consistent developer experience in this
configuration, it is important the status bar icon style is maintained across
different device implementations. Therefore, Android device implementations
MUST use white for system status icons (such as signal strength and battery
level) and notifications issued by the system, unless the icon is indicating a
problematic status or an app requests a light status bar using the
SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LIGHT_STATUS_BAR flag. When an app requests a light status bar,
Android device implementations MUST change the color of the system status icons
to black (for details, refer to
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html">R.style</a>).</p>

<h3 id="3_8_7_live_wallpapers">3.8.7. Live Wallpapers</h3>


<p>Android defines a component type and corresponding API and lifecycle that
allows applications to expose one or more
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/wallpaper/WallpaperService.html">&ldquo;Live
Wallpapers&rdquo;</a> to the end user. Live wallpapers are animations, patterns,
or similar images with limited input capabilities that display as a wallpaper,
behind other applications.</p>

<p>Hardware is considered capable of reliably running live wallpapers if it can
run all live wallpapers, with no limitations on functionality, at a reasonable
frame rate with no adverse effects on other applications. If limitations in the
hardware cause wallpapers and/or applications to crash, malfunction, consume
excessive CPU or battery power, or run at unacceptably low frame rates, the
hardware is considered incapable of running live wallpaper. As an example, some
live wallpapers may use an OpenGL 2.0 or 3.x context to render their content.
Live wallpaper will not run reliably on hardware that does not support multiple
OpenGL contexts because the live wallpaper use of an OpenGL context may
conflict with other applications that also use an OpenGL context.</p>

<p>Device implementations capable of running live wallpapers reliably as
described above SHOULD implement live wallpapers, and when implemented MUST
report the platform feature flag android.software.live_wallpaper.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_8_activity_switching">3.8.8. Activity Switching</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>As the Recent function navigation key is OPTIONAL, the requirements to
implement the overview screen is OPTIONAL for Android Television devices and
Android Watch devices.</p>
</div>


<p>The upstream Android source code includes the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/recents.html">overview
screen</a>, a system-level user interface for task switching and displaying
recently accessed activities and tasks using a thumbnail image of the
application&rsquo;s graphical state at the moment the user last left the
application. Device implementations including the recents function navigation
key as detailed in <a href="#7_2_3_navigation_keys">section 7.2.3</a> MAY alter
the interface but MUST meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST display affiliated recents as a group that moves together.</li>
  <li>MUST support at least up to 20 displayed activities.</li>
  <li>MUST at least display the title of 4 activities at a time.</li>
  <li>SHOULD display highlight color, icon, screen title in recents.</li>
  <li>MUST implement the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning">screen
  pinning behavior</a>] and provide the user with a settings menu to toggle the
  feature.</li>
  <li>SHOULD display a closing affordance ("x") but MAY delay this until user
  interacts with screens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Device implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use the upstream Android
user interface (or a similar thumbnail-based interface) for the overview screen.
</p>

<h3 id="3_8_9_input_management">3.8.9. Input Management</h3>


<p>Android includes support for
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method.html">Input
Management</a> and support for third-party input method editors. Device
implementations that allow users to use third-party input methods on the device
MUST declare the platform feature android.software.input_methods and support IME
APIs as defined in the Android SDK documentation.</p>

<p>Device implementations that declare the
android.software.input_methods feature MUST provide a user-accessible mechanism
to add and configure third-party input methods. Device implementations MUST
display the settings interface in response to the
android.settings.INPUT_METHOD_SETTINGS intent.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_10_lock_screen_media_control">3.8.10. Lock Screen Media Control</h3>


<p>The Remote Control Client API is deprecated from Android 5.0 in favor of the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MediaStyle.html">Media
Notification Template</a> that allows media applications to integrate with
playback controls that are displayed on the lock screen. Device implementations
that support a lock screen, unless an Android Automotive or Watch
implementation, MUST display the Lockscreen Notifications including the Media
Notification Template.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_11_dreams">3.8.11. Dreams</h3>


<p>Android includes support for interactive screensavers called
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html">Dreams</a>.
Dreams allows users to interact with applications when a device connected to
a power source is idle or docked in a desk dock. Android Watch devices MAY
implement Dreams, but other types of device implementations SHOULD include
support for Dreams and provide a settings option for users to configure Dreams
in response to the android.settings.DREAM_SETTINGS intent.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_12_location">3.8.12. Location</h3>


<p>When a device has a hardware sensor (e.g. GPS) that is capable of providing
the location coordinates,
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#LOCATION_MODE">location
modes</a> MUST be displayed in the Location menu within Settings.</p>

<h3 id="3_8_13_unicode_and_font">3.8.13. Unicode and Font</h3>


<p>Android includes support for color emoji characters. When Android device
implementations include an IME, devices SHOULD provide an input method to the
user for the Emoji characters defined in
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/">Unicode 6.1</a>. All
devices MUST be capable of rendering these emoji characters in color glyph.</p>

<p>Android includes support for Roboto 2 font with different
weights&mdash;sans-serif-thin, sans-serif-light, sans-serif-medium,
sans-serif-black, sans-serif-condensed, sans-serif-condensed-light&mdash;which
MUST all be included for the languages available on the device and full Unicode
7.0 coverage of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, including the Latin Extended A, B,
C, and D ranges, and all glyphs in the currency symbols block of Unicode 7.0.
</p>

<h2 id="3_9_device_administration">3.9. Device Administration</h2>

<p>Android includes features that allow security-aware applications to perform
device administration functions at the system level, such as enforcing password
policies or performing remote wipe, through the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html">Android
Device Administration API</a>]. Device implementations MUST provide an
implementation of the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html">DevicePolicyManager</a>

(alphanumeric) based lock screens MUST support the full range of
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html">device
administration</a> policies defined in the Android SDK documentation and report
the platform feature android.software.device_admin.</p>

<h3 id="3_9_1_device_provisioning">3.9.1 Device Provisioning</h3>

<h4 id="3_9_1_1_device_owner_provisioning">3.9.1.1 Device owner provisioning</h4>
<p>If a device implementation declares the android.software.device_admin

<p>The device owner provisioning process (the flow initiated by
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE">android.app.action.PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE</a>)
user experience MUST align with the AOSP implementation.</p>

<p>If the device implementation reports android.hardware.nfc, it MUST have NFC

  <li>Allocate internal (non-removable) storage as shared storage (see
  <a href="#7_6_2_application_shared_storage">section 7.6.2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed profile capable devices MUST:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declare the platform feature flag android.software.managed_users.</li>
  <li>Support managed profiles via the android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager APIs.</li>
  <li>Allow one and only
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE">one
  managed profile to be created</a>.</li>
  <li>Use an icon badge (similar to the AOSP upstream work badge) to represent
  the managed applications and widgets and other badged UI elements like Recents
  &amp; Notifications.</li>
  <li>Display a notification icon (similar to the AOSP upstream work badge) to
  indicate when user is within a managed profile application.</li>
  <li>Display a toast indicating that the user is in the managed profile if and
  when the device wakes up (ACTION_USER_PRESENT) and the foreground application
  is within the managed profile.</li>
  <li>Where a managed profile exists, show a visual affordance in the Intent
  'Chooser' to allow the user to forward the intent from the managed profile to
  the primary user or vice versa, if enabled by the Device Policy Controller.
  </li>
  <li>Where a managed profile exists, expose the following user affordances for
  both the primary user and the managed profile:
  <ul>
    <li>Separate accounting for battery, location, mobile data and storage usage
    for the primary user and managed profile.</li>
    <li>Independent management of VPN Applications installed within the primary
    user or managed profile.</li>
    <li>Independent management of applications installed within the primary user
    or managed profile.</li>
    <li>Independent management of accounts within the primary user or managed
    profile.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure the default dialer can look up caller information from the managed
  profile (if one exists) alongside those from the primary profile, if the
  Device Policy Controller permits it.</li>
  <li>MUST ensure that it satisfies all the security requirements applicable for
  a device with multiple users enabled (see
  <a href="#9_5_multi-user_support">section 9.5</a>), even though the managed
  profile is not counted as another user in addition to the primary user.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3_10_accessibility">3.10. Accessibility</h2>


<p>Android provides an accessibility layer that helps users with disabilities to
navigate their devices more easily. In addition, Android provides platform APIs
that enable
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService.html">accessibility
service implementations</a> to receive callbacks for user and system events and
generate alternate feedback mechanisms, such as text-to-speech, haptic feedback,
and trackball/d-pad navigation.</p>

<p>Device implementations include the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android Automotive implementations SHOULD provide an implementation of the
  Android accessibility framework consistent with the default Android
  implementation.</li>
  <li>Device implementations (Android Automotive excluded) MUST provide an
  implementation of the Android accessibility framework consistent with the
  default Android implementation.</li>
  <li>Device implementations (Android Automotive excluded) MUST support
  third-party accessibility service implementations through the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/package-summary.html">android.accessibilityservice APIs</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Device implementations (Android Automotive excluded) MUST generate
  AccessibilityEvents and deliver these events to all registered
  AccessibilityService implementations in a manner consistent with the default
  Android implementation</li>
  <li>Device implementations (Android Automotive and Android Watch devices with
  no audio output excluded), MUST provide a user-accessible mechanism to enable
  and disable accessibility services, and MUST display this interface in
  response to the android.provider.Settings.ACTION_ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS
  intent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, device implementations SHOULD provide an implementation of an
accessibility service on the device, and SHOULD provide a mechanism for users
to enable the accessibility service during device setup. An open source
implementation of an accessibility service is available from the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/">Eyes Free project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3_11_text-to-speech">3.11. Text-to-Speech</h2>


<p>Android includes APIs that allow applications to make use of text-to-speech
(TTS) services and allows service providers to provide implementations of TTS
services. Device implementations reporting the feature
android.hardware.audio.output MUST meet these requirements related to the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/package-summary.html">Android
TTS framework</a>.</p>

<p>Android Automotive implementations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MUST support the Android TTS framework APIs.</li>
  <li>MAY support installation of third-party TTS engines. If supported,
  partners MUST provide a user-accessible interface that allows the user to
  select a TTS engine for use at system level.</li>
</ul>

<p>All other device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST support the Android TTS framework APIs and SHOULD include a TTS
  engine supporting the languages available on the device. Note that the
  upstream Android open source software includes a full-featured TTS engine
  implementation.
  <li>MUST support installation of third-party TTS engines.
  <li>MUST provide a user-accessible interface that allows users to select a TTS
  engine for use at the system level.
</ul>

<h2 id="3_12_tv_input_framework">3.12. TV Input Framework</h2>


<p>The <a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tv/index.html">Android
Television Input Framework (TIF)</a> simplifies the delivery of live content to
Android Television devices. TIF provides a standard API to create input modules
that control Android Television devices. Android Television device
implementations MUST support TV Input Framework.</p>

<p>Device implementations that support TIF MUST declare the platform feature
android.software.live_tv.</p>

<h3 id="3_12_1_tv_app">3.12.1. TV App</h3>

<p>Any device implementation that declares support for Live TV MUST have an
installed TV application (TV App). The Android Open Source Project provides an
implementation of the TV App.</p>

<p>The TV App MUST provide facilities to install and use
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/tv/TvContract.Channels.html">TV
Channels</a> and meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device implementations MUST allow third-party TIF-based inputs
  (<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tv/index.html#third-party_input_example">third-party
  inputs</a>) to be installed and managed.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MAY provide visual separation between pre-installed
  <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tv/index.html#tv_inputs">TIF-based
  inputs</a> (installed inputs) and third-party inputs.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST NOT display the third-party inputs more than a
  single navigation action away from the TV App (i.e. expanding a list of
  third-party inputs from the TV App).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3_12_1_1_electronic_program_guide">3.12.1.1. Electronic Program
Guide</h4>

<p>Android Television device implementations MUST show an informational and
interactive overlay, which MUST include an electronic program guide (EPG)
generated from the values in the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/tv/TvContract.Programs.html">TvContract.Programs</a>
fields. The EPG MUST meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The EPG MUST display information from all installed inputs and third-party
  inputs.</li>
  <li>The EPG MAY provide visual separation between the installed inputs and
  third-party inputs.</li>
  <li>The EPG is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to display installed inputs and
  third-party inputs with equal prominence. The EPG MUST NOT display the
  third-party inputs more than a single navigation action away from the
  installed inputs on the EPG.</li>
  <li>On channel change, device implementations MUST display EPG data for the
  currently playing program.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3_12_1_2_navigation">3.12.1.2. Navigation</h4>

<p>Android Television device input devices (i.e. remote control, remote control
application, or game controller) MUST allow navigation to all actionable
sections of the screen via the D-pad. D-pad up and down MUST be used to change
live TV channels when there is no actionable section on the screen.</p>

<p>The TV App SHOULD pass key events to HDMI inputs through CEC.</p>

<h4 id="3_12_1_3_tv_input_app_linking">3.12.1.3. TV input app linking</h4>

<p>Android Television device implementations MUST support
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/tv/TvContract.Channels.html#COLUMN_APP_LINK_INTENT_URI">TV
input app linking</a>, which allows all inputs to provide activity links from
the current activity to another activity (i.e. a link from live programming to
related content). The TV App MUST show TV input app linking when it is provided.
</p>

<h1 id="4_application_packaging_compatibility">4. Application Packaging
Compatibility</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST install and run Android &ldquo;.apk&rdquo; files
as generated by the &ldquo;aapt&rdquo; tool included in the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html">official Android
SDK</a>.</p>

<p>Devices implementations MUST NOT extend either the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html">.apk</a>,
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">Android
Manifest</a>, <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/">Dalvik

  a 30 dB range from -18 dB to +12 dB re 90 dB SPL at the microphone.</li>
  <li>Total harmonic distortion SHOULD be less than 1% for 1 kHz at 90 dB SPL
  input level at the microphone.</li>
  <li>Noise reduction processing, if present, MUST be disabled.</li>
  <li>Automatic gain control, if present, MUST be disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the platform supports noise suppression technologies tuned for speech

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sampling rates</strong>: 24000, 48000</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5_5_2_audio_effects">5.5.2. Audio Effects</h3>


<p>Android provides an
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AudioEffect.html">API
for audio effects</a> for device implementations. Device implementations that
declare the feature android.hardware.audio.output:</p>

except for compressed audio passthrough output (where no audio decoding is done
on the device).</p>

<h2 id="5_6_audio_latency">5.6. Audio Latency</h2>


<p>Audio latency is the time delay as an audio signal passes through a system.
Many classes of applications rely on short latencies, to achieve real-time
sound effects.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, use the following definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>output latency</strong>. The interval between when an application
  writes a frame of PCM-coded data and when the corresponding sound can be heard
  by an external listener or observed by a transducer.</li>
  <li><strong>cold output latency</strong>. The output latency for the first
  frame, when the audio output system has been idle and powered down prior to
  the request.</li>
  <li><strong>continuous output latency</strong>. The output latency for
  subsequent frames, after the device is playing audio.</li>
  <li><strong>input latency</strong>. The interval between when an external
  sound is presented to the device and when an application reads the
  corresponding frame of PCM-coded data.</li>
  <li><strong>cold input latency</strong>. The sum of lost input time and the
  input latency for the first frame, when the audio input system has been idle
  and powered down prior to the request.</li>
  <li><strong>continuous input latency</strong>. The input latency for
  subsequent frames, while the device is capturing audio.</li>
  <li><strong>cold output jitter</strong>. The variance among separate
  measurements of cold output latency values.</li>
  <li><strong>cold input jitter</strong>. The variance among separate
  measurements of cold input latency values.</li>
  <li><strong>continuous round-trip latency</strong>. The sum of continuous
  input latency plus continuous output latency plus one buffer period. The
  buffer period term allows processing time for the app and for the app to
  mitigate phase difference between input and output streams.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenSL ES PCM buffer queue API</strong>. The set of PCM-related
  OpenSL ES APIs within Android NDK; see NDK_root/docs/opensles/index.html.</li>
</ul>

<p>Device implementations that declare android.hardware.audio.output are
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet or exceed these audio output requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cold output latency of 100 milliseconds or less</li>
  <li>continuous output latency of 45 milliseconds or less</li>
  <li>minimize the cold output jitter</li>
</ul>

<p>If a device implementation meets the requirements of this section after any
initial calibration when using the OpenSL ES PCM buffer queue API, for
continuous output latency and cold output latency over at least one supported
audio output device, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to report support for
low-latency audio, by reporting the feature android.hardware.audio.low_latency
via the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager</a>
class. Conversely, if the device implementation does not meet these requirements
it MUST NOT report support for low-latency audio.</p>

<p>Device implementations that include android.hardware.microphone are STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED to meet these input audio requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cold input latency of 100 milliseconds or less</li>
  <li>continuous input latency of 30 milliseconds or less</li>
  <li>continuous round-trip latency of 50 milliseconds or less</li>
  <li>minimize the cold input jitter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5_7_network_protocols">5.7. Network Protocols</h2>


<p>Devices MUST support the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html">media
network protocols</a> for audio and video playback as specified in the Android
SDK documentation. Specifically, devices MUST support the following media
network protocols:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RTSP (RTP, SDP)</li>
  <li>HTTP(S) progressive streaming</li>
  <li>HTTP(S)
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-03">Live
  Streaming draft protocol, Version 3</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5_8_secure_media">5.8. Secure Media</h2>


<p>Device implementations that support secure video output and are capable of
supporting secure surfaces MUST declare support for Display.FLAG_SECURE. Device
implementations that declare support for Display.FLAG_SECURE, if they support a
wireless display protocol, MUST secure the link with a cryptographically strong
mechanism such as HDCP 2.x or higher for Miracast wireless displays. Similarly
if they support a wired external display, the device implementations MUST
support HDCP 1.2 or higher. Android Television device implementations MUST
support HDCP 2.2 for devices supporting 4K resolution and HDCP 1.4 or above for
lower resolutions. The upstream Android open source implementation includes
support for wireless (Miracast) and wired (HDMI) displays that satisfies this
requirement.</p>

<h2 id="5_9_midi">5.9. Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)</h2>

<p>If a device implementation supports the inter-app MIDI software transport
(virtual MIDI devices), and it supports MIDI over <em>all</em> of the following
MIDI-capable hardware transports for which it provides generic non-MIDI
connectivity, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to report support for feature
android.software.midi via the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager</a>
class.</p>

<p>The MIDI-capable hardware transports are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>USB host mode (section 7.7 USB)</li>
  <li>USB peripheral mode (section 7.7 USB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, if the device implementation provides generic non-MIDI
connectivity over a particular MIDI-capable hardware transport listed above, but
does not support MIDI over that hardware transport, it MUST NOT report support
for feature android.software.midi.</p>

<p>MIDI over Bluetooth LE acting in central role (section 7.4.3 Bluetooth) is in
trial use status.  A device implementation that reports
feature android.software.midi, and which provides generic non-MIDI connectivity
over Bluetooth LE, SHOULD support MIDI over Bluetooth LE.</p>

<h2 id="5_10_pro_audio">5.10. Professional Audio</h2>

<p>If a device implementation meets <em>all</em> of the following requirements,
it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to report support for feature
android.hardware.audio.pro via the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager</a>
class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The device implementation MUST report support for feature
  android.hardware.audio.low_latency.</li>
  <li>The continuous round-trip audio latency, as defined in section 5.6 Audio
  Latency, MUST be 20 milliseconds or less and SHOULD be 10 milliseconds or less
  over at least one supported path.</li>
  <li>If the device includes a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack, the continuous
  round-trip audio latency MUST be 20 milliseconds or less over the audio jack
  path, and SHOULD be 10 milliseconds or less over at the audio jack path.</li>
  <li>The device implementation MUST include a USB port(s) supporting USB host
  mode and USB peripheral mode.</li>
  <li>The USB host mode MUST implement the USB audio class.</li>
  <li>If the device includes an HDMI port, the device implementation MUST
  support output in stereo and eight channels at 20-bit or 24-bit depth and 192
  kHz without bit-depth loss or resampling.</li>
  <li>The device implementation MUST report support for feature
  android.software.midi.</li>
  <li>If the device includes a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack, the device
  implementation is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to comply with section
  <a href="https://source.android.com/accessories/headset/specification.html#mobile_device_jack_specifications">Mobile
  device (jack) specifications</a> of the
  <a href="https://source.android.com/accessories/headset/specification.html">Wired

<h2 id="6_1_developer_tools">6.1. Developer Tools</h2>

<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android Developer Tools provided in
the Android SDK. Android compatible devices MUST be compatible with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html"><strong>Android
  Debug Bridge (adb)</strong></a>
  <ul>
    <li>Device implementations MUST support all adb functions as documented in
    the Android SDK including
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/input/diagnostics.html">dumpsys</a>.
    </li>
    <li>The device-side adb daemon MUST be inactive by default and there MUST be
    a user-accessible mechanism to turn on the Android Debug Bridge. If a device
    implementation omits USB peripheral mode, it MUST implement the Android
    Debug Bridge via local-area network (such as Ethernet or 802.11).</li>
    <li>Android includes support for secure adb. Secure adb enables adb on known
    authenticated hosts. Device implementations MUST support secure adb.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html"><strong>Dalvik
  Debug Monitor Service (ddms)</strong></a>
  <ul>
    <li>Device implementations MUST support all ddms features as documented in
    the Android SDK.</li>
    <li>As ddms uses adb, support for ddms SHOULD be inactive by default, but
    MUST be supported whenever the user has activated the Android Debug Bridge,
    as above.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html"><strong>Monkey</strong></a>.
  Device implementations MUST include the Monkey framework, and make it
  available for applications to use.</li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/systrace.html"><strong>SysTrace</strong></a>
  <ul>
    <li>Device implementations MUST support systrace tool as documented in the
    Android SDK. Systrace must be inactive by default, and there MUST be a
    user-accessible mechanism to turn on Systrace.</li>
    <li>Most Linux-based systems and Apple Macintosh systems recognize Android
    devices using the standard Android SDK tools, without additional support;
    however Microsoft Windows systems typically require a driver for new Android
    devices. (For instance, new vendor IDs and sometimes new device IDs require
    custom USB drivers for Windows systems.)</li>
    <li>If a device implementation is unrecognized by the adb tool as provided
    in the standard Android SDK, device implementers MUST provide Windows
    drivers allowing developers to connect to the device using the adb protocol.
    These drivers MUST be provided for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,
    Windows 8, and Windows 10 in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6_2_developer_options">6.2. Developer Options</h2>


<p>Android includes support for developers to configure application
development-related settings. Device implementations MUST honor the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS">android.settings.APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS</a>
intent to show application development-related settings The upstream Android
implementation hides the Developer Options menu by default and enables users to
launch Developer Options after pressing seven (7) times on the
<strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>About Device</strong> > <strong>Build
Number</strong> menu item. Device implementations MUST provide a consistent
experience for Developer Options. Specifically, device implementations MUST hide
Developer Options by default and MUST provide a mechanism to enable Developer
Options that is consistent with the upstream Android implementation.</p>

<h1 id="7_hardware_compatibility">7. Hardware Compatibility</h1>


<p>If a device includes a particular hardware component that has a corresponding
API for third-party developers, the device implementation MUST implement that
API as described in the Android SDK documentation. If an API in the SDK
interacts with a hardware component that is stated to be optional and the
device implementation does not possess that component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete class definitions (as documented by the SDK) for the component
  APIs MUST still be presented.</li>
  <li>The API&rsquo;s behaviors MUST be implemented as no-ops in some reasonable
  fashion.</li>
  <li>API methods MUST return null values where permitted by the SDK
  documentation.</li>
  <li>API methods MUST return no-op implementations of classes where null values
  are not permitted by the SDK documentation.</li>
  <li>API methods MUST NOT throw exceptions not documented by the SDK
  documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical example of a scenario where these requirements apply is the
telephony API: Even on non-phone devices, these APIs must be implemented as
reasonable no-ops.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST consistently report accurate hardware
configuration information via the getSystemAvailableFeatures() and
hasSystemFeature(String) methods on the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager</a>
class for the same build fingerprint.</p>

<h2 id="7_1_display_and_graphics">7.1. Display and Graphics</h2>


<p>Android includes facilities that automatically adjust application assets and
UI layouts appropriately for the device to ensure that third-party applications
run well on a
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">variety
of hardware configurations</a>. Devices MUST properly implement these APIs and
behaviors, as detailed in this section.</p>

<p>The units referenced by the requirements in this section are defined as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>physical diagonal size</strong>. The distance in inches between
  two opposing corners of the illuminated portion of the display.</li>
  <li><strong>dots per inch (dpi)</strong>. The number of pixels encompassed by
  a linear horizontal or vertical span of 1&rdquo;. Where dpi values are listed,
  both horizontal and vertical dpi must fall within the range.</li>
  <li><strong>aspect ratio</strong>. The ratio of the pixels of the longer
  dimension to the shorter dimension of the screen. For example, a display of
  480x854 pixels would be 854/480 = 1.779, or roughly &ldquo;16:9&rdquo;.</li>
  <li><strong>density-independent pixel (dp)</strong>. The virtual pixel unit
  normalized to a 160 dpi screen, calculated as: pixels = dps * (density/160).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_1_1_screen_configuration">7.1.1. Screen Configuration</h3>


<h4 id="7_1_1_1_screen_size">7.1.1.1. Screen Size</h4>

<div class="note">
<p>Android Watch devices (detailed in <a href="#2_device_types">section 2</a>)
MAY have smaller screen sizes as described in this section.</p>
</div>

<p>The Android UI framework supports a variety of different screen sizes, and
allows applications to query the device screen size (aka &ldquo;screen layout")
via android.content.res.Configuration.screenLayout with the
SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK. Device implementations MUST report the correct
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">screen
size</a> as defined in the Android SDK documentation and determined by the
upstream Android platform. Specifically, device implementations MUST report the
correct screen size according to the following logical density-independent pixel
(dp) screen dimensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Devices MUST have screen sizes of at least 426 dp x 320 dp
  (&lsquo;small&rsquo;), unless it is an Android Watch device.</li>
  <li>Devices that report screen size &lsquo;normal&rsquo; MUST have screen
  sizes of at least 480 dp x 320 dp.</li>
  <li>Devices that report screen size &lsquo;large&rsquo; MUST have screen sizes
  of at least 640 dp x 480 dp.</li>
  <li>Devices that report screen size &lsquo;xlarge&rsquo; MUST have screen
  sizes of at least 960 dp x 720 dp.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android Watch devices MUST have a screen with the physical diagonal size
  in the range from 1.1 to 2.5 inches.</li>
  <li>Other types of Android device implementations, with a physically
  integrated screen, MUST have a screen at least 2.5 inches in physical diagonal
  size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Devices MUST NOT change their reported screen size at any time.</p>

<p>Applications optionally indicate which screen sizes they support via the
&lt;supports-screens&gt; attribute in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Device
implementations MUST correctly honor applications' stated support for small,
normal, large, and xlarge screens, as described in the Android SDK
documentation.</p>

<h4 id="7_1_1_2_screen_aspect_ratio">7.1.1.2. Screen Aspect Ratio</h4>

<div class="note">
<p>Android Watch devices MAY have an aspect ratio of 1.0 (1:1).</p>
</div>


<p>The screen aspect ratio MUST be a value from 1.3333 (4:3) to 1.86 (roughly
16:9), but Android Watch devices MAY have an aspect ratio of 1.0 (1:1) because
such a device implementation will use a UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH as the
android.content.res.Configuration.uiMode.</p>

<h4 id="7_1_1_3_screen_density">7.1.1.3. Screen Density</h4>


<p>The Android UI framework defines a set of standard logical densities to help
application developers target application resources. Device implementations
MUST report only one of the following logical Android framework densities
through the android.util.DisplayMetrics APIs, and MUST execute applications at
this standard density and MUST NOT change the value at at any time for the
default display.</p>

<ul>
  <li>120 dpi (ldpi)</li>

<p>Device implementations SHOULD define the standard Android framework density
that is numerically closest to the physical density of the screen, unless that
logical density pushes the reported screen size below the minimum supported. If
the standard Android framework density that is numerically closest to the
physical density results in a screen size that is smaller than the smallest
supported compatible screen size (320 dp width), device implementations SHOULD
report the next lowest standard Android framework density.</p>

<h3 id="7_1_2_display_metrics">7.1.2. Display Metrics</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST report correct values for all display metrics
defined in
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html">android.util.DisplayMetrics</a>
and MUST report the same values regardless of whether the embedded or external
screen is used as the default display.</p>

<h3 id="7_1_3_screen_orientation">7.1.3. Screen Orientation</h3>


<p>Devices MUST report which screen orientations they support
(android.hardware.screen.portrait and/or android.hardware.screen.landscape) and
MUST report at least one supported orientation. For example, a device with a
fixed orientation landscape screen, such as a television or laptop, SHOULD only
report android.hardware.screen.landscape.</p>

<p>Devices that report both screen orientations MUST support dynamic orientation
by applications to either portrait or landscape screen orientation. That is,
the device must respect the application&rsquo;s request for a specific screen
orientation. Device implementations MAY select either portrait or landscape
orientation as the default.</p>

<p>Devices MUST report the correct value for the device&rsquo;s current
orientation, whenever queried via the
android.content.res.Configuration.orientation,
android.view.Display.getOrientation(), or other APIs.</p>

<p>Devices MUST NOT change the reported screen size or density when changing
orientation.</p>

<h3 id="7_1_4_2d_and_3d_graphics_acceleration">7.1.4. 2D and 3D Graphics
Acceleration</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST support both OpenGL ES 1.0 and 2.0, as embodied
and detailed in the Android SDK documentations. Device implementations SHOULD
support OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1 on devices capable of supporting it. Device
implementations MUST also support
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/">Android
RenderScript</a>, as detailed in the Android SDK documentation.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST also correctly identify themselves as supporting
OpenGL ES 1.0, OpenGL ES 2.0, OpenGL ES 3.0 or OpenGL 3.1. That is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The managed APIs (such as via the GLES10.getString() method) MUST report
  support for OpenGL ES 1.0 and OpenGL ES 2.0.</li>
  <li>The native C/C++ OpenGL APIs (APIs available to apps via libGLES_v1CM.so,
  libGLES_v2.so, or libEGL.so) MUST report support for OpenGL ES 1.0 and OpenGL
  ES 2.0.</li>
  <li>Device implementations that declare support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1 MUST
  support the corresponding managed APIs and include support for native C/C++
  APIs. On device implementations that declare support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1,
  libGLESv2.so MUST export the corresponding function symbols in addition to the
  OpenGL ES 2.0 function symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to OpenGL ES 3.1, Android provides an
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLES31Ext.html">extension
pack</a> with Java interfaces  and native support for advanced graphics
functionality such as tessellation and the ASTC texture compression format.
Android device implementations MAY support this extension pack, and&mdash;only
if fully implemented&mdash;MUST identify the support through the
android.hardware.opengles.aep feature flag.</p>

<p>Also, device implementations MAY implement any desired OpenGL ES extensions.
However, device implementations MUST report via the OpenGL ES managed and
native APIs all extension strings that they do support, and conversely MUST NOT
report extension strings that they do not support.</p>

<p>Note that Android includes support for applications to optionally specify
that they require specific OpenGL texture compression formats. These formats are
typically vendor-specific. Device implementations are not required by Android
to implement any specific texture compression format. However, they SHOULD
accurately report any texture compression formats that they do support, via the
getString() method in the OpenGL API.</p>

<p>Android includes a mechanism for applications to declare that they want to
enable hardware acceleration for 2D graphics at the Application, Activity,
Window, or View level through the use of a manifest tag
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html">android:hardwareAccelerated</a>
or direct API calls.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST enable hardware acceleration by default, and MUST
disable hardware acceleration if the developer so requests by setting
android:hardwareAccelerated="false&rdquo; or disabling hardware acceleration
directly through the Android View APIs.</p>

<p>In addition, device implementations MUST exhibit behavior consistent with the
Android SDK documentation on
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html">hardware
acceleration</a>.</p>

<p>Android includes a TextureView object that lets developers directly integrate
hardware-accelerated OpenGL ES textures as rendering targets in a UI hierarchy.
Device implementations MUST support the TextureView API, and MUST exhibit
consistent behavior with the upstream Android implementation.</p>

<p>Android includes support for EGL_ANDROID_RECORDABLE, an EGLConfig attribute
that indicates whether the EGLConfig supports rendering to an ANativeWindow
that records images to a video. Device implementations MUST support
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/ANDROID/EGL_ANDROID_recordable.txt">EGL_ANDROID_RECORDABLE</a>
extension.</p>

<h3 id="7_1_5_legacy_application_compatibility_mode">7.1.5. Legacy Application
Compatibility Mode</h3>


<p>Android specifies a &ldquo;compatibility mode&rdquo; in which the framework
operates in a 'normal' screen size equivalent (320dp width) mode for the benefit
of legacy applications not developed for old versions of Android that pre-date
screen-size independence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android Automotive does not support legacy compatibility mode.</li>
  <li>All other device implementations MUST include support for legacy
  application compatibility mode as implemented by the upstream Android open
  source code. That is, device implementations MUST NOT alter the triggers or
  thresholds at which compatibility mode is activated, and MUST NOT alter the
  behavior of the compatibility mode itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_1_6_screen_technology">7.1.6. Screen Technology</h3>


<p>The Android platform includes APIs that allow applications to render rich
graphics to the display. Devices MUST support all of these APIs as defined by
the Android SDK unless specifically allowed in this document. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Devices MUST support displays capable of rendering 16-bit color graphics
  and SHOULD support displays capable of 24-bit color graphics.</li>
  <li>Devices MUST support displays capable of rendering animations.</li>
  <li>The display technology used MUST have a pixel aspect ratio (PAR) between
  0.9 and 1.15. That is, the pixel aspect ratio MUST be near square (1.0) with a
  10 ~ 15% tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_1_7_external_displays">7.1.7. Secondary Displays</h3>


<p>Android includes support for secondary display to enable media sharing
capabilities and developer APIs for accessing external displays. If a device
supports an external display either via a wired, wireless, or an embedded
additional display connection then the device implementation MUST implement the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/display/DisplayManager.html">display
manager API</a> as described in the Android SDK documentation.</p>

<h2 id="7_2_input_devices">7.2. Input Devices</h2>

  <a href="http://developer.android.com">http://developer.android.com</a>.</li>
  <li>MUST provide at least one soft keyboard implementation (regardless of

<h3 id="7_2_2_non-touch_navigation">7.2.2. Non-touch Navigation</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>Android Television devices MUST support D-pad.</p>

<p>Device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAY omit a non-touch navigation option (trackball, d-pad, or wheel) if the
  device implementation is not an Android Television device.</li>
  <li>MUST report the correct value for
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html">android.content.res.Configuration.navigation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>MUST provide a reasonable alternative user interface mechanism for the
  selection and editing of text, compatible with Input Management Engines. The

  suitable for use with devices that lack non-touch navigation inputs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_2_3_navigation_keys">7.2.3. Navigation Keys</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>The availability and visibility requirement of the Home, Recents, and Back
functions differ between device types as described in this section.</p>
</div>

<p>The Home, Recents, and Back functions (mapped to the key events KEYCODE_HOME,
KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH, KEYCODE_BACK, respectively) are essential to the Android
navigation paradigm and therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android Handheld device implementations MUST provide the Home, Recents,
  and Back functions.</li>
  <li>Android Television device implementations MUST provide the Home and Back
  functions.</li>
  <li>Android Watch device implementations MUST have the Home function available
  to the user, and the Back function except for when it is in
  UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH.</li>
  <li>Android Automotive implementations MUST provide the Home function and MAY
  provide Back and Recent functions.</li>
  <li>All other types of device implementations MUST provide the Home and Back
  functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These functions MAY be implemented via dedicated physical buttons (such as
mechanical or capacitive touch buttons), or MAY be implemented using dedicated
software keys on a distinct portion of the screen, gestures, touch panel, etc.
Android supports both implementations. All of these functions MUST be
accessible with a single action (e.g. tap, double-click or gesture) when
visible.</p>

<p>Recents function, if provided, MUST have a visible button or icon unless
hidden together with other navigation functions in full-screen mode. This does
not apply to devices upgrading from earlier Android versions that have physical
buttons for navigation and no recents key.</p>

<p>The Home and Back functions, if provided, MUST each have a visible button or
icon unless hidden together with other navigation functions in full-screen mode
or when the uiMode UI_MODE_TYPE_MASK is set to UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH.</p>

<p>The Menu function is deprecated in favor of action bar since Android 4.0.
Therefore the new device implementations shipping with Android ANDROID_VERSION
and later MUST NOT implement a dedicated physical button for the Menu function.
Older device implementations SHOULD NOT implement a dedicated physical button
for the Menu function, but if the physical Menu button is implemented and the
device is running applications with targetSdkVersion > 10, the device
implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST display the action overflow button on the action bar when it is
  visible and the resulting action overflow menu popup is not empty. For a
  device implementation launched before Android 4.4 but upgrading to Android
  ANDROID_VERSION, this is RECOMMENDED.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT modify the position of the action overflow popup displayed by
  selecting the overflow button in the action bar.</li>
  <li>MAY render the action overflow popup at a modified position on the screen
  when it is displayed by selecting the physical menu button.</li>
</ul>

<p>For backwards compatibility, device implementations MUST make the Menu
function available to applications when targetSdkVersion is less than 10, either
by a physical button, a software key, or gestures. This Menu function should be
presented unless hidden together with other navigation functions.</p>

<p>Android device implementations with the support of the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_ASSIST">Assist
action</a> MUST make this accessisble with a single action (e.g. tap,
double-click, or gesture) when other navigation keys are visible, and are
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use the long-press on the Home button or software key as
the single action.</p>

<p>Device implementations MAY use a distinct portion of the screen to display
the navigation keys, but if so, MUST meet these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device implementation navigation keys MUST use a distinct portion of the
  screen, not available to applications, and MUST NOT obscure or otherwise
  interfere with the portion of the screen available to applications.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST make available a portion of the display to
  applications that meets the requirements defined in
  <a href="#7_1_1_screen_configuration">section 7.1.1</a>.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST display the navigation keys when applications
  do not specify a system UI mode, or specify SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_VISIBLE.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST present the navigation keys in an unobtrusive
  &ldquo;low profile&rdquo; (eg. dimmed) mode when applications specify
  SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST hide the navigation keys when applications
  specify SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_2_4_touchscreen_input">7.2.4. Touchscreen Input</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>Android Handhelds and Watch Devices MUST support touchscreen input.</p>
</div>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD have a pointer input system of some kind
(either mouse-like or touch). However, if a device implementation does not
support a pointer input system, it MUST NOT report the
android.hardware.touchscreen or android.hardware.faketouch feature constant.
Device implementations that do include a pointer input system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SHOULD support fully independently tracked pointers, if the device input
  system supports multiple pointers.</li>
  <li>MUST report the value of
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html">android.content.res.Configuration.touchscreen</a>
  corresponding to the type of the specific touchscreen on the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Android includes support for a variety of touchscreens, touch pads, and fake
touch input devices.
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/input/touch-devices.html">Touchscreen
based device implementations</a> are associated with a display such that the
user has the impression of directly manipulating items on screen. Since the user
is directly touching the screen, the system does not require any additional
affordances to indicate the objects being manipulated. In contrast, a fake touch
interface provides a user input system that approximates a subset of touchscreen
capabilities. For example, a mouse or remote control that drives an on-screen
cursor approximates touch, but requires the user to first point or focus then
click. Numerous input devices like the mouse, trackpad, gyro-based air mouse,
gyro-pointer, joystick, and multi-touch trackpad can support fake touch
interactions. Android includes the feature constant android.hardware.faketouch,
which corresponds to a high-fidelity non-touch (pointer-based) input device such
as a mouse or trackpad that can adequately emulate touch-based input (including
basic gesture support), and indicates that the device supports an emulated
subset of touchscreen functionality. Device implementations that declare the
fake touch feature MUST meet the fake touch requirements in
<a href="#7_2_5_fake_touch_input">section 7.2.5</a>.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST report the correct feature corresponding to the
type of input used. Device implementations that include a touchscreen
(single-touch or better) MUST report the platform feature constant
android.hardware.touchscreen. Device implementations that report the platform
feature constant android.hardware.touchscreen MUST also report the platform
feature constant android.hardware.faketouch. Device implementations that do not
include a touchscreen (and rely on a pointer device only) MUST NOT report any
touchscreen feature, and MUST report only android.hardware.faketouch if they
meet the fake touch requirements in <a href="#7_2_5_fake_touch_input">section
7.2.5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="7_2_5_fake_touch_input">7.2.5. Fake Touch Input</h3>


<p>Device implementations that declare support for android.hardware.faketouch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST report the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">absolute
  X and Y screen positions</a>of the pointer location and display a visual
  pointer on the screen.</li>
  <li>MUST report touch event with the action code that specifies the state
  change that occurs on the pointer
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">going
  down or up on the screen</a>.</li>
  <li>MUST support pointer down and up on an object on the screen, which allows
  users to emulate tap on an object on the screen.</li>
  <li>MUST support pointer down, pointer up, pointer down then pointer up in the
  same place on an object on the screen within a time threshold, which allows
  users to
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">emulate
  double tap</a> on an object on the screen.</li>
  <li>MUST support pointer down on an arbitrary point on the screen, pointer
  move to any other arbitrary point on the screen, followed by a pointer up,
  which allows users to emulate a touch drag.</li>
  <li>MUST support pointer down then allow users to quickly move the object to a
  different position on the screen and then pointer up on the screen, which
  allows users to fling an object on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Devices that declare support for
android.hardware.faketouch.multitouch.distinct MUST meet the requirements for
faketouch above, and MUST also support distinct tracking of two or more
independent pointer inputs.</p>

following subsections. If a device includes a particular sensor type that has a
corresponding API for third-party developers, the device implementation MUST
implement that API as described in the Android SDK documentation and the
Android Open Source documentation on
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/">sensors</a>. For example,
device implementations:</p>

  <li>MUST behave reasonably for all other sensor APIs (for example, by
  returning true or false as appropriate when applications attempt to register
  listeners, not calling sensor listeners when the corresponding sensors are not
  present; etc.).</li>
  <li>MUST
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html">report

  sample_time of the sensor being activated. It is acceptable for this sample to
  have an accuracy of 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list above is not comprehensive; the documented behavior of the Android
SDK and the Android Open Source Documentations on
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/">sensors</a> is to be
considered authoritative.</p>

<p>Some sensor types are composite, meaning they can be derived from data
provided by one or more other sensors. (Examples include the orientation sensor
and the linear acceleration sensor.) Device implementations SHOULD implement
these sensor types, when they include the prerequisite physical sensors as
described in
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types.html">sensor
types</a>. If a device implementation includes a composite sensor it MUST
implement the sensor as described in the Android Open Source documentation on
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types.html#composite_sensor_type_summary">composite
sensors</a>.</p>

<p>Some Android sensors support a
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/report-modes.html#continuous">&ldquo;continuous&rdquo;
trigger mode</a>, which returns data continuously. For any API indicated by the
Android SDK documentation to be a continuous sensor, device implementations MUST
continuously provide periodic data samples that SHOULD have a jitter below 3%,
where jitter is defined as the standard deviation of the difference of the
reported timestamp values between consecutive events.</p>

<p>Note that the device implementations MUST ensure that the sensor event stream
MUST NOT prevent the device CPU from entering a suspend state or waking up from
a suspend state.</p>

<p>Finally, when several sensors are activated, the power consumption SHOULD NOT
exceed the sum of the individual sensor&rsquo;s reported power consumption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telephony&rdquo; as used by the Android APIs and this document refers
specifically to hardware related to placing voice calls and sending SMS messages
via a GSM or CDMA network. While these voice calls may or may not be
packet-switched, they are for the purposes of Android considered independent of
any data connectivity that may be implemented using the same network. In other
words, the Android &ldquo;telephony&rdquo; functionality and APIs refer
specifically to voice calls and SMS. For instance, device implementations that
cannot place calls or send/receive SMS messages MUST NOT report the
android.hardware.telephony feature or any subfeatures, regardless of whether
they use a cellular network for data connectivity.</p>

<p>Android MAY be used on devices that do not include telephony hardware. That
is, Android is compatible with devices that are not phones. However, if a device
implementation does include GSM or CDMA telephony, it MUST implement full

    <li>SNEP 1.0 (defined by the NFC Forum)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>MUST include support for <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html">Android Beam</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>MUST implement the SNEP default server. Valid NDEF messages received by
    the default SNEP server MUST be dispatched to applications using the
    android.nfc.ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED intent. Disabling Android Beam in
    settings MUST NOT disable dispatch of incoming NDEF message.</li>
    <li>MUST honor the android.settings.NFCSHARING_SETTINGS intent to show
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_NFCSHARING_SETTINGS">NFC
    sharing settings</a>.</li>
    <li>MUST implement the NPP server. Messages received by the NPP server MUST
    be processed the same way as the SNEP default server.</li>
    <li>MUST implement a SNEP client and attempt to send outbound P2P NDEF to
    the default SNEP server when Android Beam is enabled. If no default SNEP
    server is found then the client MUST attempt to send to an NPP server.</li>
    <li>MUST allow foreground activities to set the outbound P2P NDEF message
    using android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessage, and
    android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessageCallback, and
    android.nfc.NfcAdapter.enableForegroundNdefPush.</li>
    <li>SHOULD use a gesture or on-screen confirmation, such as 'Touch to Beam',
    before sending outbound P2P NDEF messages.</li>
    <li>SHOULD enable Android Beam by default and MUST be able to send and
    receive using Android Beam, even when another proprietary NFC P2p mode is
    turned on.</li>
    <li>MUST support NFC Connection handover to Bluetooth when the device
    supports Bluetooth Object Push Profile. Device implementations MUST support
    connection handover to Bluetooth when using
    android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setBeamPushUris, by implementing the
    &ldquo;<a href="http://members.nfc-forum.org/specs/spec_list/#conn_handover">Connection
    Handover version 1.2</a>&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;<a href="http://members.nfc-forum.org/apps/group_public/download.php/18688/NFCForum-AD-BTSSP_1_1.pdf">Bluetooth
    Secure Simple Pairing Using NFC version 1.0</a>&rdquo; specs from the NFC
    Forum. Such an implementation MUST implement the handover LLCP service with
    service name &ldquo;urn:nfc:sn:handover&rdquo; for exchanging the handover
    request/select records over NFC, and it MUST use the Bluetooth Object Push
    Profile for the actual Bluetooth data transfer. For legacy reasons (to
    remain compatible with Android 4.1 devices), the implementation SHOULD still
    accept SNEP GET requests for exchanging the handover request/select records
    over NFC. However an implementation itself SHOULD NOT send SNEP GET requests
    for performing connection handover.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>MUST poll for all supported technologies while in NFC discovery mode.</li>
  <li>SHOULD be in NFC discovery mode while the device is awake with the screen
  active and the lock-screen unlocked.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>(Note that publicly available links are not available for the JIS, ISO, and
NFC Forum specifications cited above.)</p>

<p>Android includes support for NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE) mode. If a
device implementation does include an NFC controller chipset capable of HCE and
Application ID (AID) routing, then it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST report the android.hardware.nfc.hce feature constant.</li>
  <li>MUST support
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html">NFC
  HCE APIs</a> as defined in the Android SDK.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, device implementations MAY include reader/writer support for
the following MIFARE technologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MIFARE Classic</li>
  <li>MIFARE Ultralight</li>
  <li>NDEF on MIFARE Classic</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Android includes APIs for these MIFARE types. If a device
implementation supports MIFARE in the reader/writer role, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST implement the corresponding Android APIs as documented by the Android
  SDK.</li>
  <li>MUST report the feature com.nxp.mifare from the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager.hasSystemFeature()</a>
  method. Note that this is not a standard Android feature and as such does not
  appear as a constant in the android.content.pm.PackageManager class.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT implement the corresponding Android APIs nor report the
  com.nxp.mifare feature unless it also implements general NFC support as
  described in this section.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a device implementation does not include NFC hardware, it MUST NOT declare
the android.hardware.nfc feature from the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">android.content.pm.PackageManager.hasSystemFeature()</a>
method, and MUST implement the Android NFC API as a no-op.</p>

<p>As the classes android.nfc.NdefMessage and android.nfc.NdefRecord represent a
protocol-independent data representation format, device implementations MUST
implement these APIs even if they do not include support for NFC or declare the
android.hardware.nfc feature.</p>

<h3 id="7_4_5_minimum_network_capability">7.4.5. Minimum Network Capability</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST include support for one or more forms of data
networking. Specifically, device implementations MUST include support for at
least one data standard capable of 200Kbit/sec or greater. Examples of
technologies that satisfy this requirement include EDGE, HSPA, EV-DO, 802.11g,
Ethernet, Bluetooth PAN, etc.</p>

<p>Device implementations where a physical networking standard (such as
Ethernet) is the primary data connection SHOULD also include support for at
least one common wireless data standard, such as 802.11 (Wi-Fi).</p>

<p>Devices MAY implement more than one form of data connectivity.</p>

<p>Devices MUST include an IPv6 networking stack and support IPv6 communication
using the managed APIs, such as <code>java.net.Socket</code> and
<code>java.net.URLConnection</code>, as well as the native APIs, such as
<code>AF_INET6</code> sockets. The required level of IPv6 support depends on
the network type, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Devices that support Wi-Fi networks MUST support dual-stack and IPv6-only
  operation on Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li>Devices that support Ethernet networks MUST support dual-stack operation
  on Ethernet.</li>
  <li>Devices that support cellular data SHOULD support IPv6 operation
  (IPv6-only and possibly dual-stack) on cellular data.</li>
  <li>When a device is simultaneously connected to more than one network (e.g.,
  Wi-Fi and cellular data), it MUST simultaneously meet these requirements on
  each network to which it is connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>IPv6 MUST be enabled by default.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that IPv6 communication is as reliable as IPv4, unicast
IPv6 packets sent to the device MUST NOT be dropped, even when the screen is
not in an active state. Redundant multicast IPv6 packets, such as repeated
identical Router Advertisements, MAY be rate-limited in hardware or firmware
if doing so is necessary to save power. In such cases, rate-limiting MUST NOT
cause the device to lose IPv6 connectivity on any IPv6-compliant network that
uses RA lifetimes of at least 180 seconds.</p>

<p>IPv6 connectivity MUST be maintained in doze mode.</p>

<h3 id="7_4_6_sync_settings">7.4.6. Sync Settings</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST have the master auto-sync setting on by default so
that the method
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html">getMasterSyncAutomatically()</a>
returns &ldquo;true&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="7_5_cameras">7.5. Cameras</h2>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a rear-facing camera and MAY include a
front-facing camera. A rear-facing camera is a camera located on the side of
the device opposite the display; that is, it images scenes on the far side of
the device, like a traditional camera. A front-facing camera is a camera
located on the same side of the device as the display; that is, a camera
typically used to image the user, such as for video conferencing and similar
applications.</p>

<p>If a device implementation includes at least one camera, it SHOULD be
possible for an application to simultaneously allocate 3 bitmaps equal to the
size of the images produced by the largest-resolution camera sensor on the
device.</p>

<h3 id="7_5_1_rear-facing_camera">7.5.1. Rear-Facing Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a rear-facing camera. If a device
implementation includes at least one rear-facing camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST report the feature flag android.hardware.camera and
  android.hardware.camera.any.</li>
  <li>MUST have a resolution of at least 2 megapixels.</li>
  <li>SHOULD have either hardware auto-focus or software auto-focus implemented
  in the camera driver (transparent to application software).</li>
  <li>MAY have fixed-focus or EDOF (extended depth of field) hardware.</li>
  <li>MAY include a flash. If the Camera includes a flash, the flash lamp MUST
  NOT be lit while an android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback instance has been
  registered on a Camera preview surface, unless the application has explicitly
  enabled the flash by enabling the FLASH_MODE_AUTO or FLASH_MODE_ON attributes
  of a Camera.Parameters object. Note that this constraint does not apply to the
  device&rsquo;s built-in system camera application, but only to third-party
  applications using Camera.PreviewCallback.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_5_2_front-facing_camera">7.5.2. Front-Facing Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations MAY include a front-facing camera. If a device
implementation includes at least one front-facing camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST report the feature flag android.hardware.camera.any and
  android.hardware.camera.front.</li>
  <li>MUST have a resolution of at least VGA (640x480 pixels).</li>
  <li>MUST NOT use a front-facing camera as the default for the Camera API. The
  camera API in Android has specific support for front-facing cameras and device
  implementations MUST NOT configure the API to to treat a front-facing camera
  as the default rear-facing camera, even if it is the only camera on the
  device.</li>
  <li>MAY include features (such as auto-focus, flash, etc.) available to
  rear-facing cameras as described in
  <a href="#7_5_1_rear-facing_camera">section 7.5.1</a>.</li>
  <li>MUST horizontally reflect (i.e. mirror) the stream displayed by an app in
  a CameraPreview, as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>If the device implementation is capable of being rotated by user (such
    as automatically via an accelerometer or manually via user input), the
    camera preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the device&rsquo;s
    current orientation.</li>
    <li>If the current application has explicitly requested that the Camera
    display be rotated via a call to the
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#setDisplayOrientation(int)">android.hardware.Camera.setDisplayOrientation()</a>
    method, the camera preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the
    orientation specified by the application.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, the preview MUST be mirrored along the device&rsquo;s default
    horizontal axis.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>MUST mirror the image displayed by the postview in the same manner as the
  camera preview image stream. If the device implementation does not support
  postview, this requirement obviously does not apply.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT mirror the final captured still image or video streams returned
  to application callbacks or committed to media storage.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_5_3_external_camera">7.5.3. External Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations with USB host mode MAY include support for an external
camera that connects to the USB port. If a device includes support for an
external camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST declare the platform feature android.hardware.camera.external and
android.hardware camera.any.</li>
  <li>MUST support USB Video Class (UVC 1.0 or higher).</li>
  <li>MAY support multiple cameras.</li>
</ul>

<p>Video compression (such as MJPEG) support is RECOMMENDED to enable transfer of
high-quality unencoded streams (i.e. raw or independently compressed picture
streams). Camera-based video encoding MAY be supported. If so, a simultaneous
unencoded/ MJPEG stream (QVGA or greater resolution) MUST be accessible to the
device implementation.</p>

<h3 id="7_5_4_camera_api_behavior">7.5.4. Camera API Behavior</h3>


<p>Android includes two API packages to access the camera, the newer
android.hardware.camera2 API expose lower-level camera control to the app,
including efficient zero-copy burst/streaming flows and per-frame controls of
exposure, gain, white balance gains, color conversion, denoising, sharpening,
and more.</p>

<p>The older API package, android.hardware.Camera, is marked as deprecated in
Android 5.0 but as it should still be available for apps to use Android device
implementations MUST ensure the continued support of the API as described in
this section and in the Android SDK.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST implement the following behaviors for the
camera-related APIs, for all available cameras:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If an application has never called
  android.hardware.Camera.Parameters.setPreviewFormat(int), then the device MUST
  use android.hardware.PixelFormat.YCbCr_420_SP for preview data provided to
  application callbacks.</li>
  <li>If an application registers an android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback
  instance and the system calls the onPreviewFrame() method when the preview
  format is YCbCr_420_SP, the data in the byte[] passed into onPreviewFrame()
  must further be in the NV21 encoding format. That is, NV21 MUST be the
  default.</li>
  <li>For android.hardware.Camera, device implementations MUST support the YV12
  format (as denoted by the android.graphics.ImageFormat.YV12 constant) for
  camera previews for both front- and rear-facing cameras. (The hardware video
  encoder and camera may use any native pixel format, but the device
  implementation MUST support conversion to YV12.)</li>
  <li>For android.hardware.camera2, device implementations must support the
  android.hardware.ImageFormat.YUV_420_888 and android.hardware.ImageFormat.JPEG
  formats as outputs through the android.media.ImageReader API.</li>
</ul>

<p>Device implementations MUST still implement the full
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html">Camera
API</a> included in the Android SDK documentation, regardless of whether the
device includes hardware autofocus or other capabilities. For instance, cameras
that lack autofocus MUST still call any registered
android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback instances (even though this has no
relevance to a non-autofocus camera.) Note that this does apply to front-facing
cameras; for instance, even though most front-facing cameras do not support
autofocus, the API callbacks must still be &ldquo;faked&rdquo; as described.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST recognize and honor each parameter name defined
as a constant on the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html">android.hardware.Camera.Parameters</a>
class, if the underlying hardware supports the feature. If the device hardware
does not support a feature, the API must behave as documented. Conversely,
device implementations MUST NOT honor or recognize string constants passed to
the android.hardware.Camera.setParameters() method other than those documented
as constants on the android.hardware.Camera.Parameters. That is, device
implementations MUST support all standard Camera parameters if the hardware
allows, and MUST NOT support custom Camera parameter types. For instance, device
implementations that support image capture using high dynamic range (HDR)
imaging techniques MUST support camera parameter Camera.SCENE_MODE_HDR.</p>

<p>Because not all device implementations can fully support all the features of
the android.hardware.camera2 API, device implementations MUST report the proper
level of support with the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.html#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL">android.info.supportedHardwareLevel</a>
property as described in the Android SDK and report the appropriate
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html">framework
feature flags</a>.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST also declare its Individual camera capabilities
of android.hardware.camera2 via the android.request.availableCapabilities
property and declare the appropriate
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html">feature
flags</a>; a device must define the feature flag if any of its attached camera
devices supports the feature.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE intent
whenever a new picture is taken by the camera and the entry of the picture has
been added to the media store.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO intent
whenever a new video is recorded by the camera and the entry of the picture has
been added to the media store.</p>

<h3 id="7_5_5_camera_orientation">7.5.5. Camera Orientation</h3>


<p>Both front- and rear-facing cameras, if present, MUST be oriented so that the
long dimension of the camera aligns with the screen&rsquo;s long dimension. That
is, when the device is held in the landscape orientation, cameras MUST capture
images in the landscape orientation. This applies regardless of the
device&rsquo;s natural orientation; that is, it applies to landscape-primary
devices as well as portrait-primary devices.</p>

<p>The minimum memory values MUST be in addition to any memory space already
dedicated to hardware components such as radio, video, and so on that is not
under the kernel&rsquo;s control.</p>

<p>Device implementations with less than 512MB of memory available to the kernel
and userspace, unless an Android Watch, MUST return the value "true" for
ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice().</p>

<p>Android Television devices MUST have at least 5GB and other device
implementations MUST have at least 1.5GB of non-volatile storage available for
application private data. That is, the /data partition MUST be at least 5GB for
Android Television devices and at least 1.5GB for other device implementations.
Device implementations that run Android are <strong>STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED</strong> to have at least 3GB of non-volatile storage for
application private data so they will be able to upgrade to the future platform
releases.</p>

<p>The Android APIs include a
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html">Download
Manager</a> that applications MAY use to download data files. The device
implementation of the Download Manager MUST be capable of downloading individual
files of at least 100MB in size to the default &ldquo;cache&rdquo; location.</p>

<h3 id="7_6_2_application_shared_storage">7.6.2. Application Shared Storage</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST offer shared storage for applications also often
referred as &ldquo;shared external storage&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST be configured with shared storage mounted by
default, &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. If the shared storage is not mounted on
the Linuxpath /sdcard, then the device MUST include a Linux symbolic link from
/sdcard to the actual mount point.</p>

<p>Device implementations MAY have hardware for user-accessible removable
storage, such as a Secure Digital (SD) card slot. If this slot is used to
satisfy the shared storage requirement, the device implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST implement a toast or pop-up user interface warning the user when
  there is no SD card.</li>
  <li>MUST include a FAT-formatted SD card 1GB in size or larger OR show on the
  box and other material available at time of purchase that the SD card has to
  be separately purchased.</li>
  <li>MUST mount the SD card by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, device implementations MAY allocate internal (non-removable)
storage as shared storage for apps as included in the upstream Android Open
Source Project; device implementations SHOULD use this configuration and
software implementation. If a device implementation uses internal
(non-removable) storage to satisfy the shared storage requirement, that storage
MUST be 1GB in size or larger and mounted on /sdcard (or /sdcard MUST be a
symbolic link to the physical location if it is mounted elsewhere).</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST enforce as documented the
android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission on this shared storage.
Shared storage MUST otherwise be writable by any application that obtains that
permission.</p>

<p>Device implementations that include multiple shared storage paths (such as
both an SD card slot and shared internal storage) MUST NOT allow Android
applications to write to the secondary external storage, except for their
package-specific directories on the secondary external storage, but SHOULD
expose content from both storage paths transparently through Android&rsquo;s
media scanner service and android.provider.MediaStore.</p>

<p>Regardless of the form of shared storage used, if the device implementation
has a USB port with USB peripheral mode support, it MUST provide some mechanism
to access the contents of shared storage from a host computer. Device
implementations MAY use USB mass storage, but SHOULD use Media Transfer Protocol
to satisfy this requirement. If the device implementation supports Media
Transfer Protocol, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SHOULD be compatible with the reference Android MTP host,
  <a href="http://www.android.com/filetransfer">Android File Transfer</a>.</li>
  <li>SHOULD report a USB device class of 0x00.</li>
  <li>SHOULD report a USB interface name of 'MTP'.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7_6_3_adoptable_storage">7.6.3. Adoptable Storage</h3>

<p>Device implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to implement
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/storage/adoptable.html">adoptable
storage</a> if the removable storage device port is in a long-term stable
location, such as within the battery compartment or other protective cover.</p>

<p>Device implementations such as a television, MAY enable adoption through USB
ports as the device is expected to be static and not mobile. But for other
device implementations that are mobile in nature, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to
implement the adoptable storage in a long-term stable location, since
accidentally disconnecting them can cause data loss/corruption.</p>

<h2 id="7_7_usb">7.7. USB</h2>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD support USB peripheral mode and SHOULD support
USB host mode.</p>

<p>If a device implementation includes a USB port supporting peripheral mode:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The port MUST be connectable to a USB host that has a standard type-A or
  type-C USB port.</li>
  <li>The port SHOULD use micro-A, micro-AB or type-C USB form factor. Existing
  and new Android devices are <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet these
  requirements</strong> so they will be able to upgrade to the future platform
  releases.</li>
  <li>The port SHOULD be centered in the middle of an edge. Device
  implementations SHOULD either locate the port on the bottom of the device
  (according to natural orientation) or enable software screen rotation for all
  apps (including home screen), so that the display draws correctly when the
  device is oriented with the port at bottom. Existing and new Android devices
  are <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet these requirements</strong> so they
  will be able to upgrade to future platform releases.</li>
  <li>It MUST allow a USB host connected with the Android device to access the
  contents of the shared storage volume using either USB mass storage or Media
  Transfer Protocol.</li>
  <li>It SHOULD implement the Android Open Accessory (AOA) API and specification
  as documented in the Android SDK documentation, and if it is an Android
  Handheld device it MUST implement the AOA API. Device implementations
  implementing the AOA specification:
  <ul>
    <li>MUST declare support for the hardware feature
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/accessory.html">android.hardware.usb.accessory</a>.

    audio class</a>as documented in the Android SDK documentation.</li>
    <li>The USB mass storage class MUST include the string "android" at the end
    of the interface description <code>iInterface</code> string of the USB mass
    storage</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It SHOULD implement support to draw 1.5 A current during HS chirp and
  traffic as specified in the
  <a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Battery_Charging_1.2.pdf">USB
  battery charging specification</a>. Existing and new Android devices are
  <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet these requirements</strong> so they will
  be able to upgrade to the future platform releases.</li>
  <li>The value of iSerialNumber in USB standard device descriptor MUST be equal
  to the value of android.os.Build.SERIAL.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a device implementation includes a USB port supporting host mode, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SHOULD use a type-C USB port, if the device implementation supports USB
  3.1.</li>
  <li>MAY use a non-standard port form factor, but if so MUST ship with a cable
  or cables adapting the port to a standard type-A or type-C USB port.</li>
  <li>MAY use a micro-AB USB port, but if so SHOULD ship with a cable or cables
  adapting the port to a standard type-A or type-C USB port.</li>
  <li>is <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> to implement the

<p>Device implementations MAY omit a microphone. However, if a device
implementation omits a microphone, it MUST NOT report the
android.hardware.microphone feature constant, and MUST implement the audio
recording API at least as no-ops, per

<h3 id="7_8_3_near_ultrasound">7.8.3. Near-Ultrasound </h3>

<p>Near-Ultrasound audio is the 18.5 kHz to 20 kHz band. Device implementations

<h1 id="8_performance_power">8. Performance and Power</h1>


<p>Some minimum performance and power criteria are critical to the user
experience and impact the baseline assumptions developers would have when
developing an app. Android Watch devices SHOULD and other type of device
implementations MUST meet the following criteria.</p>

<h2 id="8_1_user_experience_consistency">8.1. User Experience Consistency</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST provide a smooth user interface by ensuring a
consistent frame rate and response times for applications and games. Device
implementations MUST meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistent frame latency</strong>. Inconsistent frame latency or a
  delay to render frames MUST NOT happen more often than 5 frames in a second,
  and SHOULD be below 1 frames in a second.</li>
  <li><strong>User interface latency</strong>. Device implementations MUST
  ensure low latency user experience by scrolling a list of 10K list entries as
  defined by the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) in less than 36 secs.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Task switching</strong>. When multiple applications have been
  launched, re-launching an already-running application after it has been
  launched MUST take less than 1 second.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8_2_file_i_o_access_performance">8.2. File I/O Access Performance</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST ensure internal storage file access performance
consistency for read and write operations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sequential write</strong>. Device implementations MUST ensure a
  sequential write performance of at least 5MB/s for a 256MB file using 10MB
  write buffer.</li>
  <li><strong>Random write</strong>. Device implementations MUST ensure a random
  write performance of at least 0.5MB/s for a 256MB file using 4KB write buffer.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sequential read</strong>. Device implementations MUST ensure a
  sequential read performance of at least 15MB/s for a 256MB file using 10MB
  write buffer.</li>
  <li><strong>Random read</strong>. Device implementations MUST ensure a random
  read performance of at least 3.5MB/s for a 256MB file using 4KB write buffer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8_3_power_saving_modes">8.3. Power-Saving Modes</h2>

<p>All apps exempted from App Standby and/or Doze mode MUST be made visible to
the end user. Further, the triggering, maintenance, wakeup algorithms and
the use of Global system settings of these power-saving modes MUST not deviate
from the Android Open Source Project.</p>

<h2 id="8_4_power_consumption_accounting">8.4. Power Consumption Accounting</h2>

<p>A more accurate accounting and reporting of the power consumption provides
the app developer both the incentives and the tools to optimize the power usage
pattern of the application. Therefore, device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST be able to track hardware component power usage and attribute that
  power usage to specific applications. Specifically, implementations:
    <ul>
      <li>MUST provide a per-component power profile that defines the
      <a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html">current
      consumption value</a> for each hardware component and the approximate
      battery drain caused by the components over time as documented in the
      Android Open Source Project site.</li>
      <li>MUST report all power consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh).
      </li>
      <li>SHOULD be attributed to the hardware component itself if unable to
      attribute hardware component power usage to an application.</li>
      <li>MUST report CPU power consumption per each process's UID. The Android
      Open Source Project meets the requirement through the
      <code>uid_cputime</code> kernel module implementation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MUST make this power usage available via the
  <a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batterystats.html"><code>adb
  shell dumpsys batterystats</code></a> shell command to the app developer.</li>
  <li>MUST honor the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_POWER_USAGE_SUMMARY">android.intent.action.POWER_USAGE_SUMMARY</a>
  intent and display a settings menu that shows this power usage.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="9_security_model_compatibility">9. Security Model Compatibility</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST implement a security model consistent with the
Android platform security model as defined in
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Security
and Permissions reference document</a> in the APIs in the Android developer
documentation. Device implementations MUST support installation of self-signed
applications without requiring any additional permissions/certificates from any
third parties/authorities. Specifically, compatible devices MUST support the
security mechanisms described in the follow subsections.</p>

<h2 id="9_1_permissions">9.1. Permissions</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Android
permissions model</a> as defined in the Android developer documentation.
Specifically, implementations MUST enforce each permission defined as described
in the SDK documentation; no permissions may be omitted, altered, or ignored.
Implementations MAY add additional permissions, provided the new permission ID
strings are not in the android.* namespace.</p>

<p>Permissions with a protection level of dangerous are runtime permissions.
Applications with targetSdkVersion > 22 request them at runtime. Device
implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST show a dedicated interface for the user to decide whether to grant
  the requested runtime permissions and also provide an interface for the user
  to manage runtime permissions.</li>
  <li>MUST have one and only one implementation of both user interfaces.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT grant any runtime permissions to preinstalled apps unless:
  <ul>
    <li>the user's consent can be obtained before the application uses it</li>
    <li>the runtime permissions are associated with an intent pattern for which
    the preinstalled application is set as the default handler</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9_2_uid_and_process_isolation">9.2. UID and Process Isolation</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android application sandbox model, in
which each application runs as a unique Unixstyle UID and in a separate
process. Device implementations MUST support running multiple applications as
the same Linux user ID, provided that the applications are properly signed and
constructed, as defined in the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Security
and Permissions reference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="9_3_filesystem_permissions">9.3. Filesystem Permissions</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android file access permissions model
as defined in the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Security
and Permissions reference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="9_4_alternate_execution_environments">9.4. Alternate Execution
Environments</h2>


<p>Device implementations MAY include runtime environments that execute
applications using some other software or technology than the Dalvik Executable
Format or native code. However, such alternate execution environments MUST NOT
compromise the Android security model or the security of installed Android
applications, as described in this section.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST themselves be Android applications, and abide by the
standard Android security model, as described elsewhere in
<a href="#9_security_model_compatibility">section 9</a>.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST NOT be granted access to resources protected by
permissions not requested in the runtime&rsquo;s AndroidManifest.xml file via
the &lt;uses-permission&gt; mechanism.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST NOT permit applications to make use of features
protected by Android permissions restricted to system applications.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST abide by the Android sandbox model. Specifically,
alternate runtimes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SHOULD install apps via the PackageManager into separate Android sandboxes
  (Linux user IDs, etc.).</li>
  <li>MAY provide a single Android sandbox shared by all applications using the
  alternate runtime.</li>
  <li>Installed applications using an alternate runtime MUST NOT reuse the
  sandbox of any other app installed on the device, except through the standard
  Android mechanisms of shared user ID and signing certificate.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT launch with, grant, or be granted access to the sandboxes
  corresponding to other Android applications.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT be launched with, be granted, or grant to other applications any
  privileges of the superuser (root), or of any other user ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>The .apk files of alternate runtimes MAY be included in the system image of a
device implementation, but MUST be signed with a key distinct from the key used
to sign other applications included with the device implementation.</p>

<p>When installing applications, alternate runtimes MUST obtain user consent for
the Android permissions used by the application. If an application needs to make
use of a device resource for which there is a corresponding Android permission
(such as Camera, GPS, etc.), the alternate runtime MUST inform the user that the
application will be able to access that resource. If the runtime environment
does not record application capabilities in this manner, the runtime environment
MUST list all permissions held by the runtime itself when installing any
application using that runtime.</p>

<h2 id="9_5_multi-user_support">9.5. Multi-User Support</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>This feature is optional for all device types.</p>
</div>


<p>Android includes
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html">support
for multiple users</a> and provides support for full user isolation. Device
implementations MAY enable multiple users, but when enabled MUST meet the
following requirements related to
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/storage/traditional.html">multi-user
support</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device implementations that do not declare the android.hardware.telephony
  feature flag MUST support restricted profiles, a feature that allows device
  owners to manage additional users and their capabilities on the device. With
  restricted profiles, device owners can quickly set up separate environments
  for additional users to work in, with the ability to manage finer-grained
  restrictions in the apps that are available in those environments.</li>
  <li>Conversely device implementations that declare the
  android.hardware.telephony feature flag MUST NOT support restricted profiles
  but MUST align with the AOSP implementation of controls to enable /disable
  other users from accessing the voice calls and SMS.</li>
  <li>Device implementations MUST, for each user, implement a security model
  consistent with the Android platform security model as defined in
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Security
  and Permissions reference document</a> in the APIs.</li>
  <li>Each user instance on an Android device MUST have separate and isolated
  external storage directories. Device implementations MAY store multiple users'
  data on the same volume or filesystem. However, the device implementation MUST
  ensure that applications owned by and running on behalf a given user cannot
  list, read, or write to data owned by any other user. Note that removable
  media, such as SD card slots, can allow one user to access another&rsquo;s
  data by means of a host PC. For this reason, device implementations that use
  removable media for the external storage APIs MUST encrypt the contents of the
  SD card if multiuser is enabled using a key stored only on non-removable media
  accessible only to the system. As this will make the media unreadable by a
  host PC, device implementations will be required to switch to MTP or a similar
  system to provide host PCs with access to the current user&rsquo;s data.
  Accordingly, device implementations MAY but SHOULD NOT enable multi-user if
  they use
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html">removable
  media</a> for primary external storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9_6_premium_sms_warning">9.6. Premium SMS Warning</h2>


<p>Android includes support for warning users of any outgoing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code">premium SMS message</a>.
Premium SMS messages are text messages sent to a service registered with a
carrier that may incur a charge to the user. Device implementations that declare
support for android.hardware.telephony MUST warn users before sending a SMS
message to numbers identified by regular expressions defined in
/data/misc/sms/codes.xml file in the device. The upstream Android Open Source
Project provides an implementation that satisfies this requirement.</p>

<h2 id="9_7_kernel_security_features">9.7. Kernel Security Features</h2>


<p>The Android Sandbox includes features that use the Security-Enhanced Linux
(SELinux) mandatory access control (MAC) system and other security features in
the Linux kernel. SELinux or any other security features implemented below
the Android framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST maintain compatibility with existing applications.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT have a visible user interface when a security violation is
  detected and successfully blocked, but MAY have a visible user interface when
  an unblocked security violation occurs resulting in a successful exploit.</li>
  <li>SHOULD NOT be user or developer configurable.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any API for configuration of policy is exposed to an application that can
affect another application (such as a Device Administration API), the API MUST
NOT allow configurations that break compatibility.</p>

<p>Devices MUST implement SELinux or, if using a kernel other than Linux, an
equivalent mandatory access control system. Devices MUST also meet the
following requirements, which are satisfied by the reference implementation
in the upstream Android Open Source Project.</p>

<p>Device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MUST set SELinux to global enforcing mode.</li>
  <li>MUST configure all domains in enforcing mode. No permissive mode domains
  are allowed, including domains specific to a device/vendor.</li>
  <li>MUST NOT modify, omit, or replace the neverallow rules present within the
  system/sepolicy folder provided in the upstream Android Open Source Project
  (AOSP) and the policy MUST compile with all neverallow rules present, for both
  AOSP SELinux domains as well as device/vendor specific domains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Device implementations SHOULD retain the default SELinux policy provided in
the system/sepolicy folder of the upstream Android Open Source Project and
only further add to this policy for their own device-specific configuration.
Device implementations MUST be compatible with the upstream Android Open Source
Project.</p>

<h2 id="9_8_privacy">9.8. Privacy</h2>

<p>If the device implements functionality in the system that captures the
contents displayed on the screen and/or records the audio stream played on the
device, it MUST continuously notify the user whenever this functionality is
enabled and actively capturing/recording.</p>

<p>If a device implementation has a mechanism that routes network data traffic
through a proxy server or VPN gateway by default (for example, preloading a VPN
service with android.permission.CONTROL_VPN granted), the device implementation
MUST ask for the user's consent before enabling that mechanism.</p>

<p>If a device implementation has a USB port with USB peripheral mode support,
it MUST present a user interface asking for the user's consent before allowing
access to the contents of the shared storage over the USB port.</p>

<h2 id="9_9_full-disk_encryption">9.9. Full-Disk Encryption</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>Optional for Android device implementations without a lock screen.</p>
</div>

<p>If the device implementation supports a secure lock screen reporting
"<code>true</code>" for
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html#isDeviceSecure()">KeyguardManager.isDeviceSecure()</a>,
and is not a device with restricted memory as reported through the
ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice() method, then the device MUST support full-disk
<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/encryption/index.html">encryption</a>
of the application private data (/data partition), as well as the application
shared storage partition (/sdcard partition) if it is a permanent, non-removable
part of the device.</p>

<p>For device implementations supporting full-disk encryption and with Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) crypto performance above 50MiB/sec, the full-disk
encryption MUST be enabled by default at the time the user has completed the
out-of-box setup experience. If a device implementation is already launched on
an earlier Android version with full-disk encryption disabled by default, such a
device cannot meet the requirement through a system software update and thus MAY
be exempted.</p>

<p>Encryption MUST use AES with a key of 128-bits (or greater) and a mode designed
for storage (for example, AES-XTS, AES-CBC-ESSIV). The encryption key MUST NOT
be written to storage at any time without being encrypted. Other than when in
active use, the encryption key SHOULD be AES encrypted with the lockscreen
passcode stretched using a slow stretching algorithm (e.g. PBKDF2 or scrypt).
If the user has not specified a lockscreen passcode or has disabled use of the
passcode for encryption, the system SHOULD use a default passcode to wrap the
encryption key. If the device provides a hardware-backed keystore, the password
stretching algorithm MUST be cryptographically bound to that keystore. The
encryption key MUST NOT be sent off the device (even when wrapped with the user
passcode and/or hardware bound key). The upstream Android Open Source project
provides a preferred implementation of this feature based on the Linux kernel
feature dm-crypt.</p>

<h2 id="9_10_verified_boot">9.10. Verified Boot</h2>

<p>
Verified boot is a feature that guarantees the integrity of the device software.
If a device implementation supports the feature, it MUST:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declare the platform feature flag android.software.verified_boot.</li>
  <li>Perform verification on every boot sequence.</li>
  <li>Start verification from an immutable hardware key that is the root of
  trust and go all the way up to the system partition.</li>
  <li>Implement each stage of verification to check the integrity and
  authenticity of all the bytes in the next stage before executing the code in
  the next stage.</li>
  <li>Use verification algorithms as strong as current recommendations from NIST
  for hashing algorithms (SHA-256) and public key sizes (RSA-2048).</li>
</ul>

<p>The upstream Android Open Source Project provides a preferred implementation
of this feature based on the Linux kernel feature dm-verity.</p>

<p>Starting from Android 6.0, device implementations with Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) crypto perfomance above 50MiB/seconds MUST support verified boot
for device integrity. If a device implementation is already launched without
supporting verified boot on an earlier version of Android, such a device can not
add support for this feature with a system software update and thus are exempted
from the requirement.</p>

<h2 id="9_11_keys_and_credentials">9.11. Keys and Credentials</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html">Android
Keystore System</a> allows app developers to store cryptographic keys in a
container and use them in cryptographic
operations through the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyChain.html">KeyChain
API</a> or the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore.html">Keystore
API</a>.</p>

<p>All Android device implementations MUST meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SHOULD not limit the number of keys that can be generated, and MUST at
  least allow more than 8,192 keys to be imported.</li>
  <li>The lock screen authentication MUST rate limit attempts and SHOULD have an
  exponential backoff algorithm as implemented in the Android Open Source
  Project.</li>
  <li>When the device implementation supports a secure lock screen and has a
  secure hardware such as a Secure Element (SE) where a Trusted Execution
  Environment (TEE) can be implemented, then it:
   <ul>
    <li>Is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to back up the keystore implementation with the
    secure hardware. The upstream Android Open Source Project provides the
    Keymaster Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) implementation that can be used
    to satisfy this requirement.</li>
    <li>MUST perform the lock screen authentication in the secure hardware if
    the device has a hardware-backed keystore implementation and only when
    successful allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. The upstream
    Android Open Source Project provides the
    <a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html">Gatekeeper
    Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</a> that can be used to satisfy this
    requirement.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that while the above TEE-related requirements are stated as STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED, the Compatibility Definition for the next API version is planned to
changed these to REQIUIRED. If a device implementation is already launched on an
earlier Android version and has not implemented a trusted operating system on
the secure hardware, such a device might not be able to meet the requirements
through a system software update and thus is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to implement a
TEE.</p>

<h2 id="9_12_data_deletion">9.12. Data Deletion</h2>

<p>Devices MUST provide users with a mechanism to perform a "Factory Data Reset"
that allows logical and physical deletion of all data. This MUST satisfy
relevant industry standards for data deletion such as NIST SP800-88. This MUST
be used for the implementation of the wipeData() API (part of the Android Device
Administration API) described in <a href="#3_9_device_administration">section
3.9 Device Administration</a>.</p>

<p>Devices MAY provide a fast data wipe that conducts a logical data erase.</p>

<h1 id="10_software_compatibility_testing">10. Software Compatibility
Testing</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST pass all tests described in this section.</p>

<p>However, note that no software test package is fully comprehensive. For this
reason, device implementers are <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> to make
the minimum number of changes as possible to the reference and preferred
implementation of Android available from the Android Open Source Project. This
will minimize the risk of introducing bugs that create incompatibilities
requiring rework and potential device updates.</p>

<h2 id="10_1_compatibility_test_suite">10.1. Compatibility Test Suite</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST pass the
<a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html">Android
Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)</a> available from the Android Open Source
Project, using the final shipping software on the device. Additionally, device
implementers SHOULD use the reference implementation in the Android Open Source
tree as much as possible, and MUST ensure compatibility in cases of ambiguity in
CTS and for any reimplementations of parts of the reference source code.</p>

<p>The CTS is designed to be run on an actual device. Like any software, the CTS
may itself contain bugs. The CTS will be versioned independently of this
Compatibility Definition, and multiple revisions of the CTS may be released for
Android ANDROID_VERSION. Device implementations MUST pass the latest CTS version
available at the time the device software is completed.</p>

<h2 id="10_2_cts_verifier">10.2. CTS Verifier</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST correctly execute all applicable cases in the CTS
Verifier. The CTS Verifier is included with the Compatibility Test Suite, and
is intended to be run by a human operator to test functionality that cannot be
tested by an automated system, such as correct functioning of a camera and
sensors.</p>

<p>The CTS Verifier has tests for many kinds of hardware, including some
hardware that is optional. Device implementations MUST pass all tests for
hardware that they possess; for instance, if a device possesses an
accelerometer, it MUST correctly execute the Accelerometer test case in the CTS
Verifier. Test cases for features noted as optional by this Compatibility
Definition Document MAY be skipped or omitted.</p>

<p>Every device and every build MUST correctly run the CTS Verifier, as noted
above. However, since many builds are very similar, device implementers are not
expected to explicitly run the CTS Verifier on builds that differ only in
trivial ways. Specifically, device implementations that differ from an
implementation that has passed the CTS Verifier only by the set of included
locales, branding, etc. MAY omit the CTS Verifier test.</p>

<h1 id="11_updatable_software">11. Updatable Software</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST include a mechanism to replace the entirety of
the system software. The mechanism need not perform &ldquo;live&rdquo;
upgrades&mdash;that is, a device restart MAY be required.</p>

<p>Any method can be used, provided that it can replace the entirety of the
software preinstalled on the device. For instance, any of the following
approaches will satisfy this requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Over-the-air (OTA)&rdquo; downloads with offline update via
  reboot.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Tethered&rdquo; updates over USB from a host PC.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Offline&rdquo; updates via a reboot and update from a file on
  removable storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the device implementation includes support for an unmetered data
connection such as 802.11 or Bluetooth PAN (Personal Area Network) profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android Automotive implementations SHOULD support OTA downloads with
  offline update via reboot.</li>
  <li>All other device implementations MUST support OTA downloads with offline
  update via reboot.</li>
</ul>

<p>The update mechanism used MUST support updates without wiping user data. That
is, the update mechanism MUST preserve application private data and application
shared data. Note that the upstream Android software includes an update
mechanism that satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p>For device implementations that are launching with Android ANDROID_VERSION
and later, the update mechanism SHOULD support verifying that the system image
is binary identical to expected result following an OTA. The block-based OTA
implementation in the upstream Android Open Source Project, added since Android
5.1, satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p>If an error is found in a device implementation after it has been released
but within its reasonable product lifetime that is determined in consultation
with the Android Compatibility Team to affect the compatibility of third-party
applications, the device implementer MUST correct the error via a software
update available that can be applied per the mechanism just described.</p>

<p>Android includes features that allow the Device Owner app (if present) to
control the installation of system updates. To facilitate this, the system
update subsystem for devices that report android.software.device_admin MUST
implement the behavior described in the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/SystemUpdatePolicy.html">SystemUpdatePolicy</a>
class.</p>
