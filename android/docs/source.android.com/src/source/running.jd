<p>This page complements the main page about
<a href="building.html">Building the System</a> with
information that is specific to individual devices.</p>

<h2 class="nexus-devices">Nexus devices</h2>
<p>
It is possible to build for Nexus devices using the AOSP
builds and the relevant hardware-specific binaries.
For a list of available Android builds and the Nexus devices
they can be installed on, see <a
href="build-numbers.html#source-code-tags-and-builds">Source
Code, Tags, and Builds</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Due to hardware differences, do not use 4.1.1 on a Nexus 7 that
was originally sold with 4.1.2 or newer.</p>

<h2 class="other-devices">Other devices</h2>
<p>The Motorola Xoom can be used in the Wi-Fi configuration "wingray"
sold in the USA, with Android 4.1.2. Graphics and audio are functional
as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and the orientation sensors.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://pandaboard.org">PandaBoard</a> a.k.a. "panda" can be used
in the jb-mr1-dev-plus-aosp branch, but is considered experimental.
The specific details to use a PandaBoard with the Android Open-Source Project
are in the file <code>device/ti/panda/README</code> in the source tree.</p>

<h2 id="building-fastboot-and-adb">Building fastboot and adb</h2>
<p>If you don't already have those tools, fastboot and adb can be built with
the regular build system. Follow the instructions on the page about
<a href="building.html">Building a System</a>, and replace the main
<code>make</code> command with:</p>
<pre><code>$ make fastboot adb
</code></pre>

<h2 id="booting-into-fastboot-mode">Booting into fastboot mode</h2>
<p>During a cold boot, the following key combinations can be used to boot into fastboot mode,
which is a mode in the bootloader that can be used to flash the devices:</p>

<p>Also, the command <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> can be used to reboot from
Android directly into the bootloader with no key combinations.</p>
<h2 id="unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</h2>
<p>It's only possible to flash a custom system if the bootloader allows it.</p>
<p>The bootloader is locked by default. With the device in fastboot mode, the
bootloader is unlocked with</p>
<pre><code>$ fastboot oem unlock
</code></pre>
<p>The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for
privacy reasons. It only needs to be run once.</p>
<p>All data on the phone is erased, i.e. both the applications' private data
and the shared data that is accessible over USB, including photos and
movies. Be sure to make a backup of any precious files you have before
unlocking the bootloader.</p>
<p>On Nexus 10, after unlocking the bootloader, the internal storage is
left unformatted and must be formatted with</p>
<pre><code>$ fastboot format cache
$ fastboot format userdata
</code></pre>
<p>The bootloader can be locked back with</p>
<pre><code>$ fastboot oem lock
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this erases user data on Xoom (including the shared USB data).</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-proprietary-binaries">Obtaining proprietary binaries</h2>
<p>The Android Open-Source Project can't be used
from pure source code only, and requires additional hardware-related proprietary
libraries to run, specifically for hardware graphics acceleration.</p>
<p>Official binaries for the supported devices running tagged AOSP release
branches can be downloaded from <a
href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers">Google's Nexus
driver page</a>. These add access to additional hardware capabilities with
non-open source code. To instead build the AOSP master branch, use the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/blobs-preview">Binaries
Preview for Nexus Devices</a>.</p>
<p>When building the master branch for a device, the binaries for the most
recent numbered release or with the most recent date are the ones that should
be used.</p>
<h3 id="extracting-the-proprietary-binaries">Extracting the proprietary binaries</h3>
<p>Each set of binaries comes as a self-extracting script in a compressed archive.
After uncompressing each archive, run the included self-extracting script
from the root of the source tree, confirm that you agree to the terms of the
enclosed license agreement, and the binaries and their matching makefiles
will get installed in the <code>vendor/</code> hierarchy of the source tree.</p>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-when-adding-proprietary-binaries">Cleaning up when adding proprietary binaries</h3>
<p>In order to make sure that the newly installed binaries are properly
taken into account after being extracted, the existing output of any previous
build needs to be deleted with</p>
<pre><code>$ make clobber
</code></pre>
<h2 id="picking-and-building-the-configuration-that-matches-a-device">Picking and building the configuration that matches a device</h2>
<p>The recommended builds for the various devices are available through
the lunch menu, accessed when running the <code>lunch</code> command with no arguments. Factory images and binaries for Nexus devices can be downloaded from:</p>

<p>Do not use 4.1.1 on a Nexus 7 that was originally sold with 4.1.2
or newer.</p>
<h2 id="flashing-a-device">Flashing a device</h2>
<p>Set the device in fastboot mode if necessary (see above).</p>
<p>An entire Android system can be flashed in a single command: this writes
the boot, recovery and system partitions together after verifying that the
system being flashed is compatible with the installed bootloader and radio,
and reboots the system. This also erases all the user data, similarly to
<code>fastboot oem unlock</code> mentioned earlier.</p>
<pre><code>$ fastboot -w flashall
</code></pre>
<p>Note that filesystems created via fastboot on Motorola Xoom aren't working
optimally, and it is strongly recommended to re-create them through recovery</p>
<pre><code>$ adb reboot recovery
</code></pre>
<p>Once in recovery, open the menu (press Power + Volume Up), wipe the cache
partition, then wipe data.</p>
<h2 id="restoring-a-device-to-its-original-factory-state">Restoring a device to

<p>Factory images for Nexus 5, Nexus 10, Nexus 4, Nexus Q, Nexus 7, Galaxy
Nexus (GSM/HSPA+ "yakju" and "takju",
and CDMA/LTE "mysid" and "mysidspr"), Nexus S, and Nexus S 4G are available
from <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">Google's
