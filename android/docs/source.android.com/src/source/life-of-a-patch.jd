<p>The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) uses a web-based code review tool
known as <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/">Gerrit</a>.
The image below is a flowchart that details what happens to
a patch, once it's been written. Though it may appear complex, the majority of
the steps below are performed in the web application.</p>
<p>For full instructions on how to get set up to use gerrit and git, please
see the <a href="submit-patches.html">Submitting Patches</a> page.</p>
