<p>The Trade Federation source is stored in git along with the rest of the Android platform, and
uses the Android platform build system to create its binary.  First and foremost, 
<a href="/source/initializing.html">follow these instructions</a> to set up your machine to be
able to compile and run things from the Android tree.</p>

<h2>Getting the Source</h2>
<p>The TF source lives in the Android codebase, but you need to specify an extra option to get at it.
<a href="/source/downloading.html">Follow these instructions</a> to download the source, but use
the branch <code>tradefed</code> to actually pull down the Trade Federation source.  The actual
command you run should look something like</p>
<pre><code>$ repo init -u https://â€¦/manifest -b tradefed</code></pre>

<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Trade Federation is set up in a lightweight "unbundled" branch that uses slightly different build
commands from the platform source.  In particular, unbundled branches use the <code>tapas</code>
command to set up the build environment, rather than the <code>lunch</code> command.  So starting
from the root directory of the source tree you checked out, try:</p>
<pre><code>$ . build/envsetup.sh
$ tapas tradefed-all
$ m -j8
</pre></code>

Note that once the <code>$ . build/envsetup.sh</code> step is done, the other two commands will run
equally well from anywhere in the tree.

<h2>Running from Command Line</h2>
<p>First and foremost, tradefed requires the <code>adb</code> utility to be in your current
<code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=$PATH:&lt;path to adb&gt;</pre></code>

<p>Building TF using the steps mentioned above will add the <code>tradefed.sh</code> launcher script
to your path.  So to launch the TF console, run</p>
<pre><code>$ tradefed.sh</pre></code>

<p>At this point, your environment is set up for Trade Federation.</p>
