<p>The <code>dumpsys</code> tool runs on the device and provides information about the status
of system services.  </p>

<h2 id=how_to_use_dumpsys>How to use dumpsys</h2>

<p>If you run <code>adb shell dumpsys</code>, youâ€™ll get diagnostic output for
all system services, which is usually more than you want.  For more manageable
output, specify the service you would like to examine.  </p>

<p>For example, the following command:</p>

<pre>
$ adb shell dumpsys input
</pre>

<p>provides system data for input components such as touchscreens or built-in
keyboards.</p>
