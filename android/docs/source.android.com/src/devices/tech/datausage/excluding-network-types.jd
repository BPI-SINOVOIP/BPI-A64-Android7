<p>A mobile operator may wish to exclude specific network types from the
total data usage calculated by a device.  For example, network traffic
over an MMS APN may be “zero-rated” by a mobile operator.  To support
this, the set of network types used to calculate total data usage can
be configured through the <code>config_data_usage_network_types</code> resource
at build time.</p>
<p>Some mobile radio implementations may have unique Linux network
interfaces for each active APN, while other radios may force multiple
APNs to coexist on a single interface.  Android can collect network
statistics from both designs, but <code>config_data_usage_network_types</code> is
not be effective at excluding APNs forced to coexist on a single
interface.</p>
