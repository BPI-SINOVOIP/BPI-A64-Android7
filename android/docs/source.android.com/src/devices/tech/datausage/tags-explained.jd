<p>Tags represent one of the metrics the data usage counters will be
tracked against. By default, and implicitly, a tag is just based on
the UID. The UID is used as the base for policing, and cannot be
ignored. So a tag will always at least represent a UID (uid_tag). A
tag can be explicitly augmented with an "accounting tag" which is
associated with a UID. User space can use
<code>TrafficStats.setThreadStatsTag()</code> to set the acct_tag portion of the
tag which is then used  with sockets: all data belonging to that
socket will be counted against the tag. The policing is then based on
the tag's uid_tag portion, and stats are collected for the acct_tag
portion separately.</p>
<p>Without explicit tagging, the qtaguid module will assume the
<code>default_tag:  {acct_tag=0, uid_tag=10003}</code></p>
<pre><code>    a:  {acct_tag=1, uid_tag=10003}
    b:  {acct_tag=2, uid_tag=10003}
    c:  {acct_tag=3, uid_tag=10003}
</code></pre>
<p><code>a, b, c…</code> represent explicit tags associated with specific sockets.</p>
<p><code>default_tag (acct_tag=0)</code> is the default accounting tag that contains
the total traffic for that uid, including all untagged
traffic, and is typically used to enforce policing/quota rules.</p>
<p>These tags can be used to profile the network traffic of an
application into separate logical categories (at a network socket
level). Such tags can be removed, reapplied, or modified during
runtime.</p>
<p>The qtaguid module has been implemented on <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/q/project:kernel/common+branch:android-3.0,n,z">kernel/common branch of
android-3.0</a></p>
