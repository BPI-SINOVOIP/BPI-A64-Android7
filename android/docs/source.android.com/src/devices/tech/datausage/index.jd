<p>Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) introduces new features that help
users understand and control how their device uses network data.  It
monitors overall data usage, and supports warning or limit thresholds
which will trigger notifications or disable mobile data when usage
exceeds a specific quota.</p>
<p>Data usage is also tracked on a per-application basis, enabling users
to visually explore historical usage in the Settings app. Users can
also restrict how specific applications are allowed to use data when
running in the background.</p>
<p>The documentation in this section is intended for systems integrators
and mobile operators, to help explain technical details they should be
aware of when porting Android to specific devices.  These details are
summarized below, and the
<a href="mailto:android-porting+subscribe@googlegroups.com">android-porting</a>
mailing list is a good place for further discussion.</p>
