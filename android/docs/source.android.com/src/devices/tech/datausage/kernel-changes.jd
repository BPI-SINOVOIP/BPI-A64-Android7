<p>This is a summary of the main changes in the kernel that diverge from mainline.</p>
<ul>
<li>added net/netfilter/xt_qtaguid*</li>
<li>imported then modified net/netfilter/xt_quota2.c from xtables-addons project</li>
<li>fixes in net/netfilter/ip6_tables.c</li>
<li>modified ip*t_REJECT.c</li>
<li>modified net/netfilter/xt_socket.c</li>
</ul>
<p>A few comments on the kernel configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>xt_qtaguid masquerades as xt_owner and relies on xt_socket and itself relies on the connection tracker.</li>
<li>The connection tracker can't handle large SIP packets, it must be disabled.</li>
<li>The modified xt_quota2 uses the NFLOG support to notify userspace.</li>
</ul>
