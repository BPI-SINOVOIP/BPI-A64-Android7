<p>Devices running Android 5.0 and later with the managed_users feature
declared can be used in a <a href="http://www.android.com/work/">corporate
environment</a> under the auspices of each companyâ€™s information technology (IT)
department. This is possible with the introduction of <a href="multi-user.html">multiple
users</a>, <a href="managed-profiles.html">managed profiles</a>, and enterprise
mobility management (EMM) applications, as well as enhancements to default
<a

<a
href="{@docRoot}security/verifiedboot/index.html">verified
boot</a>, and <a

<p>With these enhancements, either users or their IT departments may create
managed profiles that separate corporate employer data from personal user
information. Follow the documents within this section of the site to properly
implement corporate device administration.</p>
