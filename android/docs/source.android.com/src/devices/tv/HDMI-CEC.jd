<h2 id=intro>Introduction</h2>

<p>The High-Definition Multimedia Interface Consumer Electronics Control (HDMI-CEC) standard allows mulitmedia consumer products to communicate and
exchange information with each other. HDMI-CEC supports many features, like
Remote Control Passthrough and System Audio Control, but one of the most
popular is One Touch Play. One Touch Play lets a media source device turn on
the TV and switch its input port automatically, so you don’t have to search for
the TV remote to switch from your Chromecast to Blu-ray player.</p>

<p>Most manufacturers have adopted HDMI-CEC so their devices work with other
companies’ devices. But because each manufacturer implements the HDMI-CEC
standard in different ways, devices don’t always understand each other and
supported features vary between devices. Because of this variance, consumers
can’t safely assume that two products that claim CEC support are completely
compatible.</p>

<h2 id=solution>Solution</h2>


<p>With the introduction of the Android TV Input Framework (TIF), HDMI-CEC brings
together all connected devices and minimizes compatibility issues. Android has
created a system service called <code>HdmiControlService</code> to alleviate these pain points.</p>

<p>By offering <code>HdmiControlService</code> as a part of the Android ecosystem, Android hopes to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard implementation of HDMI-CEC for all manufacturers, which will reduce
device incompatibility. Previously, manufacturers had to develop their own
implementations of HDMI-CEC or use third-party solutions.</li>
  <li>A service that is well-tested against numerous HDMI-CEC devices already in the
market. Android has been conducting rigorous research on compatibility issues
found among the products and collecting useful advice from partners experienced
in the technology. The CEC service is designed to keep a healthy balance
between the standard and modifications to that standard so that it works with
the products that people already use.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=overall_design>Overall design</h2>


<p><code>HdmiControlService</code> is connected with the rest of the system like TV Input Framework (TIF), Audio service, and Power service to implement the various features the standard
specifies.</p>

<p>See the following diagram for a depiction of the switch from a custom CEC
controller to an implementation of the simpler HDMI-CEC hardware abstraction
layer (HAL).</p>

<h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2>


<p>See the following diagram for a detailed view of the HDMI control service.</p>

<img src="images/HDMI_Control_Service_Flow.png" alt="Image that shows how HDMI Control service details">

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> HDMI Control Service details</p>

<p>Here are the key ingredients to a proper Android HDMI-CEC implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li> A manager class <code>HdmiControlManager</code> provides privileged apps with the API. System services like TV Input Manager service and Audio service can grab the service directly.</li>
  <li> The service is designed to allow hosting more than one type of logical device.</li>
  <li> HDMI-CEC is connected with the hardware via a hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
to simplify handling differences of the protocol and signalling mechanisms
between the devices. The HAL definition is available for device manufacturers
to use to implement the HAL layer.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Device manufacturers should add the following line into <code>PRODUCT_COPY_FILES</code> in <code>device.mk</code>.</p>

<pre>
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
frameworks/native/data/etc/android.hardware.hdmi.cec.xml:system/etc/permissions/android.hardware.hdmi.cec.xml
</pre>


<p>Depending on whether your device is a HDMI sink device or a HDMI source device,
device manufacturers need to set <code>ro.hdmi.device_type</code> in <code>device.mk</code> for <code>HdmiControlService</code> to work correctly.</p>

<p>For HDMI source devices, like Over the Top (OTT) boxes, set:</p>

<pre>
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += ro.hdmi.device_type=<strong>4</strong>
</pre>

<p>For HDMI sink devices, like panel TVs, set:</p>

<pre>
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += ro.hdmi.device_type=<strong>0</strong></pre>
</p>


<ul>
  <li> A device manufacturer-provided proprietary CEC controller cannot coexist with <code>HdmiControlService</code>. It must be disabled or removed. Common requirements for this come from the need to handle manufacturer-specific commands. The manufacturer-specific
command handler should be incorporated into the service by extending/modifying
it. This work is left to the device manufacturer and not specified by Android.
Note that any change made in the service for manufacturer-specific commands
must not interfere with the way standard commands are handled or the device
will not be Android compatible.</li>
  <li> Access to the HDMI-CEC service is guarded with the protection level <code>SignatureOrSystem</code>. Only system components or the apps placed in <code>/system/priv-app</code> can access the service. This is to protect the service from abuse by apps with malicious intent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Android supports type <code>TV/Display(0)</code> and <code>playback device(4)</code>, which can issue the One Touch Play command to display. The other types (tuner
and recorder) are currently not supported.</p>

<h2 id=hdmi-cec_hal_definition>HDMI-CEC HAL definition</h2>


<p>In order to have the service in action, the HDMI-CEC HAL needs to be
implemented to the definition provided by Android. It abstracts differences in
the hardware level and exposes the primitive operations (allocate/read/write,
etc.) to the upper layer through API.</p>

<p>The API calls that device manufacturers must support are:</p>

<h3 id=tx_rx_events>TX/RX/Events</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>send_message</code></li>
  <li><code>register_event_callback</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=info>Info</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>get_physical_address</code></li>
  <li><code>get_version</code></li>
  <li><code>get_vendor_id</code></li>
  <li><code>get_port_info</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=logical_address>Logical Address</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>add_logical_address</code></li>
  <li><code>clear_logical_address</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=status>Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>is_connected set_option</code></li>
  <li><code>set_audio_return_channel</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The API lets the service make use of the hardware resource to send/receive
HDMI-CEC commands, configure necessary settings, and (optionally) communicate
with the microprocessor in the underlying platform that will take over the CEC
control while the Android system is in standby mode.</p>

<h2 id=testing>Testing</h2>


<p>Device manufacturers must test the APIs of the HDMI-CEC HAL with their own
tools to make sure they provide expected functionality.</p>
