<h2 id=media>Media</h2>

<p>If a user connects a headset to the device while playing media, the audio
output (sound) should be heard only via the headset.</p>

<p>For example, while playing media with the <a
href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-UniversalMusicPlayer">open
source</a> <a
href="https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/03/a-new-reference-app-for-multi-device.html">Universal
Music Player</a>, pressing the play/pause button should pause playback.
Pressing the same button when media is paused should resume playback.</p>

<p>If the headset has volume control buttons: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Pressing the volume-up button should increase the volume incrementally each
time the button is pressed until maximum volume is reached. If the volume-up
button is pressed and held, the volume should gradually increase to maximum
volume setting.
  <li> Pressing the volume-down button should decrease the volume incrementally each
time the button is pressed until entirely muted. If the volume-down button is
pressed and held, the volume should gradually decrease to silent.
  <li> Pressing the volume-up button when in a muted state should increase the volume
one notch at a time starting from silent.
</ul>

<p><strong>Recommended for Apps</strong>: On disconnecting the headset, sound output should stop and playback should
pause. On reconnecting, playback should not start again unless the user presses
the play button. Upon pressing play, sound output should again be limited to
the headset.</p>

<h2 id=telephony>Telephony</h2>


<p>If a user connects a headset to the device while a call is in progress, the
conversation should continue on the headset. The call should not get
disconnected, and the microphone should not be muted. If present, volume
buttons should behave identically to media playback.</p>

<p>Pressing the play/pause button while a phone call is in progress should toggle
the microphone state between muted and unmuted. If a user receives calls while
using the headset, the voice assistance button should allow handling of those
calls:</p>

<ul>
  <li> While in a phone call, pressing quickly on the play/pause button should mute
the microphone. And if pressed quickly again, the microphone should un-mute.
  <li> While in a phone call, a long press on the play/pause button should end the
telephone call.
  <li> While receiving a phone call, pressing quickly on the play/pause button should
accept the call.
  <li> While receiving a phone call, a long press on the play/pause button should
reject the call.
</ul>

<h2 id=voice_assistance>Voice assistance</h2>

<p>The voice assistance button is a new inline control standard for consistently
and conveniently accessing a voice search feature from any approved wearable
audio device. By pressing the button defined here, users will hear the two-tone
signature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earcon">earcon</a> indicating that the device is listening and ready to receive the query.</p>

<p>Whether embedded into a multi-function button or highlighted as a single
button, it should always be quickly accessible, ergonomically correct, and
placed intuitively as described in the following section.</p>

<h2 id=buttons_and_function_mapping>Buttons and function mapping recommendations</h2>

<p>The following diagrams depict the acceptable configuration of the Android voice
assistance button.</p>

<h3 id=options>Options</h3>

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 9.</strong> Button configuration options. </p>

<p>Buttons should always be front facing and spaced out so they can be easily
located by touch only.</p>

<h3 id=spacing>Spacing</h3>

<p>Buttons must be more than 5mm and must have at least 5mm distance between
buttons. For four-button headsets, there must be at least 9mm of space between
button D and the cluster of other buttons. </p>
