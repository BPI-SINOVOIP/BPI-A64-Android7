<p>Every Android release includes dozens of security enhancements to protect
users. Here are some of the major security enhancements available in Android
7.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>File-based encryption</strong>. Encrypting at the file level,
  instead of encrypting the entire storage area as a single unit, better
  isolates and protects individual users and profiles (such as personal and
  work) on a device.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct Boot</strong>. Enabled by file-based encryption, Direct
  Boot allows certain apps such as alarm clock and accessibility features to
  run when device is powered on but not unlocked.</li>
  <li><strong>Verified Boot</strong>. Verified Boot is now strictly enforced to
  prevent compromised devices from booting; it supports error correction to
  improve reliability against non-malicious data corruption.</li>
  <li><strong>SELinux</strong>. Updated SELinux configuration and increased
  seccomp coverage further locks down the application sandbox and reduces attack
  surface.</li>
  <li><strong>Library load-order randomization and improved ASLR</strong>.
  Increased randomness makes some code-reuse attacks less reliable.</li>
  <li><strong>Kernel hardening</strong>. Added additional memory protection for
  newer kernels by marking portions of kernel memory as read-only, restricting
  kernel access to userspace addresses and further reducing the existing attack
  surface.</li>
  <li><strong>APK signature scheme v2</strong>. Introduced a whole-file signature
  scheme that improves verification speed and strengthens integrity guarantees.</li>
  <li><strong>Trusted CA store</strong>. To make it easier for apps to control
  access to their secure network traffic, user-installed certificate authorities
  and those installed through Device Admin APIs are no longer trusted by default
  for apps targeting API Level 24+. Additionally, all new Android devices must
  ship with the same trusted CA store.</li>
  <li><strong>Network Security Config</strong>. Configure network security and TLS
  through a declarative configuration file.</li>
</ul>
