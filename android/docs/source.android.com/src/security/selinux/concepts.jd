<p>Review this page to become familar with the concepts at play within SELinux.</p>

<h2 id=mandatory_access_control>Mandatory access control</h2>

<p>Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux), is a mandatory access control (MAC) system
for the Linux operating system.  As a MAC system, it differs from Linux’s
familiar discretionary access control (DAC) system.  In a DAC system, a concept
of ownership exists, whereby an owner of a particular resource controls access
permissions associated with it.  This is generally coarse-grained and subject
to unintended privilege escalation.  A MAC system, however, consults a central
authority for a decision on all access attempts.</p>

<p>SELinux has been implemented as part of the Linux Security Module (LSM)
framework, which recognizes various kernel objects, and sensitive actions
performed on them.  At the point at which each of these actions would be
performed, an LSM hook function is called to determine whether or not the
action should be allowed based on the information for it stored in an opaque
security object. SELinux provides an implementation for these hooks and
management of these security objects, which combine with its own policy, to
determine the access decisions.</p>

<p>In conjunction with other Android security measures, Android's access control
policy greatly limits the potential damage of compromised machines and
accounts. Using tools like Android's discretionary and mandatory access
controls gives you a structure to ensure your software runs only at the minimum
privilege level. This mitigates the effects of attacks and reduces the
likelihood of errant processes overwriting or even transmitting data.</p>

<p>Starting in Android 4.3, SELinux provides a mandatory access control (MAC)
umbrella over traditional discretionary access control (DAC) environments. For
instance, software must typically run as the root user account to write to raw
block devices. In a traditional DAC-based Linux environment, if the root user
becomes compromised that user can write to every raw block device. However,
SELinux can be used to label these devices so the process assigned the root
privilege can write to only those specified in the associated policy. In this
way, the process cannot overwrite data and system settings outside of the
specific raw block device.</p>

<p>See <a href="implement.html#use_cases">Use Cases</a> for more examples of threats and ways to address them with SELinux.</p>

<h2 id=enforcement_levels>Enforcement levels</h2>

<p>Become familiar with the following terms to understand how SELinux can be
implemented to varying strengths.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Permissive</em> - SELinux security policy is not enforced, only logged.
  <li><em>Enforcing</em> - Security policy is enforced and logged. Failures appear as EPERM errors.
</ul>

<p>This choice is binary and determines whether your policy takes action or merely
allows you to gather potential failures. Permissive is especially useful during
implementation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Unconfined</em> - A very light policy that prohibits certain tasks and provides a temporary
stop-gap during development. Should not be used for anything outside of the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
  <li><em>Confined</em> - A custom-written policy designed for the service. That policy should define
precisely what is allowed.
</ul>

<p>Unconfined policies are available to help implement SELinux in Android quickly.
They are suitable for most root-level applications. But they should be
converted to confined policies wherever possible over time to restrict each
application to precisely the resources it needs.</p>

<p>Ideally, your policy is both in enforcing mode and confined. Unconfined
policies in enforcement mode can mask potential violations that would have been
logged in permissive mode with a confined policy. Therefore, we strongly
recommend partners implement true confined policies.</p>

<h2 id=labels_rules_and_domains>Labels, rules and domains</h2>

<p>SELinux depends upon <em>labels</em> to match actions and policies. Labels determine what is allowed. Sockets,
files, and processes all have labels in SELinux. SELinux decisions are based
fundamentally on labels assigned to these objects and the policy defining how
they may interact.  In SELinux, a label takes the form:
user:role:type:mls_level, where the type is the primary component of the access
decisions, which may be modified by the other sections components which make up
the label.  The objects are mapped to classes and the different types of access
for each class are represented by permissions. </p>

<p>The policy rules come in the form: allow <em>domains</em> <em>types</em>:<em>classes</em> <em>permissions</em>;, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Domain</em> - A label for the process or set of processes.  Also called a domain type as it is just a type for a process.
  <li><em>Type</em> - A label for the object (e.g. file, socket) or set of objects.
  <li><em>Class</em> - The kind of object (e.g. file, socket) being accessed.
  <li><em>Permission</em> - The operation (e.g. read, write) being performed.
</ul>

<p>And so an example use of this would follow the structure:</p>
<code>allow appdomain app_data_file:file rw_file_perms;</code>

<p>This says that all application domains are allowed to read and write files labeled
app_data_file. Note that this rule relies upon macros defined in the
global_macros file, and other helpful macros can also be found in the te_macros
file, both of which can be found in the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/">system/sepolicy</a> directory in the AOSP source tree. Macros are provided for common groupings of classes, permissions and
rules, and should be used whenever possible to help reduce the likelihood of
failures due to denials on related permissions.</p>

<p>In addition to individually listing domains or types in a rule, one can also refer to a set of domains or types via an <em>attribute</em>.  An attribute is simply a name for a set of domains or types.  Each domain or type can be associated with any number of attributes.  When a rule is written that specifies an attribute name, that name is automatically expanded to the list of domains or types associated with the attribute.  For example, the <em>domain</em> attribute is associated with all process domains, and the <em>file_type</em> attribute is associated with all file types.</p>

<p>Use the syntax above to create avc rules that comprise the essence of an
SELinux policy.  A rule takes the form:
<pre>
&lt;rule variant&gt; &lt;source_types&gt; &lt;target_types&gt; : &lt;classes&gt; &lt;permissions&gt;
</pre>

<p>The rule indicates what should happen when a subject labeled with any of the <em>source_types</em> attempts an action corresponding to any of the <em>permissions</em> on an object with any of the class <em>classes</em> which has any of the <em>target_types</em> label.  The most common example of one of these rules is an allow rule, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
allow domain null_device:chr_file { open };
</pre>


<p>
This rule allows a process with any <em>domain</em> associated with the ‘domain’ attribute to take the action described by the <em>permission</em> ‘open’ on an object of <em>class</em> ‘chr_file’ (character device file) that has the <em>target_type</em> label of ‘null_device.’  In practice, this rule may be extended to include other permissions: </p>

<pre>
allow domain null_device:chr_file { getattr open read ioctl lock append write};
</pre>

<p>When combined with the knowledge that ‘domain’ is an attribute assigned to
all process domains and
that null_device is the label for the character device /dev/null, this rule basically
permits reading and writing to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>domain</em> generally corresponds to a process and will have a label associated with it.</p>

<p>For example, a typical Android app is running in its own process and has the
label of untrusted_app that grants it certain restricted permissions.</p>

<p>Platform apps built into the system run under a separate label and are granted
a distinct set of permissions. System UID apps that are part of the core Android
system run under the system_app label for yet another set of privileges.</p>

<p>Access to the following generic labels should never be directly allowed to domains; instead, a more specific type should be created for the object or objects:</p>

<ul>
  <li> socket_device
  <li> device
  <li> block_device
  <li> default_service
  <li> system_data_file
  <li> tmpfs
</ul>
