Where did the docs go?
----------------------

Most of the docs are now hosted online at https://developer.android.com/ndk/.
A few are still located only in directory "docs/Additional\_library\_docs/".
In particular, to see the documentation for Android native audio based on OpenSL ES,
open a web browser for Additional\_library\_docs/opensles/index.html and reference PDF.
