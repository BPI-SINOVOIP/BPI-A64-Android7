<h1>Native Development Kit (NDK) Documentation</h1>

<p>Most of the documentation for the NDK is located on the
<a href="{@docRoot}ndk/index.html">Android developer site.</a> There, you can find
guides, API reference documentation, and other information about the NDK.</p>

<p>From this page, you can find documentation about several 
native APIs for Android that ship as part of the NDK download. These APIs
include:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/openmax/al/">OpenMAX AL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/opensles/">OpenSL ES</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html">RenderScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also access these documents by navigating to the
<a href="Additional_library_docs"><code>Additional_library_docs</code></a>
directory.</p>
