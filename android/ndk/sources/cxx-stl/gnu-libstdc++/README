This directory contains the headers and prebuilt binaries for the
GNU libstdc++-v3 C++ Standard Template Library implementation.

These are generated from the toolchain sources by build.py in this directory.

To use it, define APP_STL to 'gnustl_static' in your Application.mk.
See docs/CPLUSPLUS-SUPPORT.html for more details.

This implementation fully supports C++ exceptions and RTTI.
