This intention replaces a method declaration
which has an array as its last parameter with the equivalent varargs method
declaration. Relevant array initializer expressions at calls to this method are
automatically unwrapped. <br>
For safety, this intention is disabled unless the project uses JDK 5.0 or greater.
