This inspection reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">System.runFinalizersOnExity()</font></b> from
    Groovy code. This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language.  It is inherently non-thread-safe,
may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may effect parts of the program far removed from it's call point.
It is deprecated, and it's use strongly discouraged.
