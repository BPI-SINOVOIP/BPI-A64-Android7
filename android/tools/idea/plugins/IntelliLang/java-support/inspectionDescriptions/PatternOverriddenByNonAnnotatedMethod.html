          This inspecton Checks whether a method without any <code>@Pattern</code> or derived annotation overrides an annotated
          method from its base classes. This is not necessary for the error-highlighting inside the editor, however the
          runtime-check instrumentation doesn't pick up annotations from base-class methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          A QuickFix is provided to add an annotation that matches the one from the base-class method. This ensures the
          runtime-check instrumentation works correctly.
