Provides interfaces for interacting with IDEA's debugger. The main extensibility
point of the debugger is the possibility for a plugin to provide custom mapping of
positions in compiled classes to source code lines, which is mostly necessary for
JSP debugging. Such mapping is provided through the {@link PositionManager} interface.
One standard implementation of this interface for application servers compatible
with the JSR-45 specification is provided by the {@link JSR45PositionManager} class.
Another implementation of this interface, which can be used as an example for the debugger
API, is found in the Tomcat plugin.
