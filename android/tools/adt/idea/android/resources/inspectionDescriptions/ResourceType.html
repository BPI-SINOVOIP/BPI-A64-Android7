This inspection looks at Android API calls and ensures that the correct type of resource is passed
to an int-parameter expecting resources of a given type; it checks that APIs which expect an RGB color integer
are passed actual colors rather than color resources; it checks that APIs which require a certain permission
have the permission declared in the manifest; it checks that parameters expected to fall within a given range
actually do; it checks that results of certain method calls are looked at by the caller, and so on.
