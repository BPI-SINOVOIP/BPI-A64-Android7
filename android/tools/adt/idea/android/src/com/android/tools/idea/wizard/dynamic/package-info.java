/**
 * Support for wizards that allow dynamically adding multiple paths and steps (unlike the wizards
 * offered by IntelliJ, which require a fixed list of steps up front).
 * <p/>
 * A path is a collection of one or more steps, and wizards contain one or more paths. Furthermore,
 * different wizards may share (their own instances of) the same path class.
 * <p/>
 * Data is passed along the wizard from step to step via a
 * {@link com.android.tools.idea.wizard.dynamic.ScopedStateStore}, which is a hashtable of data,
 * essentially.
