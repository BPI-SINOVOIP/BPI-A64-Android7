 * Consider all files under gradle's build folder as generated source files so that search results under build folder will be
 * grouped into 'Generated Source' category.
 * Details: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=121156
 *
 * Alternative could be marking the entire build folder as generated source folder, but this have many side affects, e.g. a broken source
 * file (e.g. have some syntax error / warning) under build folder that is not actually used in the project would be marked as red too and
 * the user might be asked to fix it.
