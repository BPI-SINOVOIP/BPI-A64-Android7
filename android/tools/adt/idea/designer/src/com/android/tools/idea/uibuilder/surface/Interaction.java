/**
 * An interaction is a mouse or keyboard driven user operation, such as a
 * swipe-select or a resize. It can be thought of as a session, since it is
 * initiated, updated during user manipulation, and finally completed or
 * canceled. An interaction is associated with a single undo transaction (although
 * some interactions don't actually edit anything, such as a selection), and an
 * interaction can have a number of graphics {@link Layer}s which are added and
 * cleaned up on behalf of the interaction by the system.
 * <p/>
 * Interactions are typically mouse oriented. There are pros and cons to using native drag
 * &amp; drop, so various interactions will differ in whether they use it.
 * In particular, you should use drag &amp; drop if your interaction should:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Show a native drag &amp; drop cursor
 * <li> Copy or move data, especially if this applies outside the canvas
 *    control window or even the application itself
 * </ul>
 * You might want to avoid using native drag &amp; drop if your interaction should:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Continue updating itself even when the mouse cursor leaves the
 *    canvas window (in a drag &amp; drop interaction, as soon as you leave the canvas
 *    the drag source is no longer informed of mouse updates, whereas a regular
 *    mouse listener is)
 * <li> Respond to modifier keys (for example, if toggling the Shift key
 *    should constrain motion as is common during resizing, and so on)
 * <li> Use no special cursor (for example, during a marquee selection interaction we
 *     don't want a native drag &amp; drop cursor)
 *  </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Examples of interactions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Move (dragging to reorder or change hierarchy of views or change visual
 * layout attributes)
 * <li>Marquee (swiping out a rectangle to make a selection)
 * <li>Resize (dragging some edge or corner of a widget to change its size, for
 * example to some new fixed size, or to "attach" it to some other edge.)
 * <li>Inline Editing (editing the text of some text-oriented widget like a
 * label or a button)
 * <li>Link (associate two or more widgets in some way, such as an
 *   "is required" widget linked to a text field)
 * </ul>
