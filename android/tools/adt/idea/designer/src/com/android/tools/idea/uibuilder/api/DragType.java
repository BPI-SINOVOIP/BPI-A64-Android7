/**
 * Describes different types of drag modes. The semantics of how a drop is handled
 * can vary:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create. This is typically what happens when dragging from the palette;
 * a new copy of the component is created.</li>
 * <li>Copy. This is typically what happens when dragging with a modifier key;
 * a new copy of the components are created.</li>
 * <li>Move. This is typically done by dragging one or more widgets around in
 * the canvas; when moving the widget within a single parent, it may only
 * translate into some updated layout parameters or widget reordering, whereas
 * when moving from one parent to another widgets are moved in the hierarchy
 * as well. This is also used for dragging widgets from one designer to another;
 * then a new copy of the components are created.</li>
 * <li>Paste. Is similar to a copy. It typically tries to preserve internal
 * relationships and id's when possible. If you for example select 3 widgets and
 * cut them, if you paste them the widgets will come back in the exact same place
 * with the same id's. If you paste a second time, the widgets will now all have
 * new unique id's (and any internal references to each other are also updated.)</li>
 * </ul>
