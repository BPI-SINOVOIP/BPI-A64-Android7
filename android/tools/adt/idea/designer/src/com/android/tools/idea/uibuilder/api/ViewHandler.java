   * (where views are created in the destination and then deleted from the source), and
   * even when views are constructed programmatically from other view handlers. The

   * @param insertType whether this node was created as part of a newly created view, or
   * @return true, or false if the view handler wants to cancel this component
   * creation. This typically happens if for example the view handler tries
   * to customize the component by for example asking the user for a specific
   * resource (via {@link ViewEditor#displayResourceInput(EnumSet, String)}),
   * and then the user cancels that dialog. At that point we don't want an
   * unconfigured component lingering around, so the component create handler
   * cancels the drop instead by returning false.
