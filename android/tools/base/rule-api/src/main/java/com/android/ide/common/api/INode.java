 * The primordial characteristic of a node is the fully qualified View class name that
 * it represents (a.k.a FQCN), for example "android.view.View" or "android.widget.Button".
 * <p/>
 * There are 2 kind of nodes:
 * - Nodes matching a view actually rendered in the layout canvas have a valid "bounds"
 *   rectangle that describe their position in pixels in the canvas. <br/>
 * - Nodes created by IViewRule scripts but not yet rendered have an invalid bounds rectangle
 *   since they only exist in the uncommitted XML model and not yet in the rendered View model.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: This is not a public or final API; if you rely on this be prepared
 * to adjust your code for the next tools release.</b>
