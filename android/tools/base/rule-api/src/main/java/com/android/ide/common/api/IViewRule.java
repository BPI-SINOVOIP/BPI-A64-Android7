/**
 * An {@link IViewRule} describes the rules that apply to a given Layout or View object
 * in the Graphical Layout Editor.
 * <p/>
 * Rules are implemented by builtin layout helpers, or 3rd party layout rule implementations
 * provided with or for a given 3rd party widget.
 * <p/>
 * A 3rd party layout rule should use the same fully qualified class name as the layout it
 * represents, plus "Rule" as a suffix. For example, the layout rule for the
 * LinearLayout class is LinearLayoutRule, in the same package.
 * <p/>
 * Rule instances are stateless. They are created once per View class to handle and are shared
 * across platforms or editor instances. As such, rules methods should never cache editor-specific
 * arguments that they might receive.
