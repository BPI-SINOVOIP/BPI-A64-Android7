Device Validator
================
  The device validator is a simple tool for validating XML that contains
  information about a list of Android devices. Simply run the tool from the
  command-line with the names of the XML files to validate as the arguments.
  If an XML file fails to validate, the errors will be printed to standard
  out and the program will terminate with a non-zero exit status.

  See device_example.xml for an example valid XML file, and devices.xsd
  for the schema the XML must conform to.
