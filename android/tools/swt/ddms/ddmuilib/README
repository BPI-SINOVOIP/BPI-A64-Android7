Using the Eclipse projects for ddmuilib.

ddmuilib requires SWT to compile.

SWT is available in the depot under prebuild/<platform>/swt

Because the build path cannot contain relative path that are not inside the project directory,
the .classpath file references a user library called ANDROID_SWT.

In order to compile the project, make a user library called ANDROID_SWT containing the jar files
available at prebuild/<platform>/swt.

You also need a user library called ANDROID_JFREECHART containing the jar files
available at prebuild/common/jfreechart.
