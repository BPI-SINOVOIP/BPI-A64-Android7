Using the Eclipse project SdkUiLib
----------------------------------

1- sdkuilib requires SWT to compile.

SWT is available in the tree under prebuild/<platform>/swt

Because the build path cannot contain relative path that are not inside the project directory,
the .classpath file references a user library called ANDROID_SWT.

In order to compile the project:
- Open Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries
- Create a new user library named ANDROID_SWT
- Add the following 4 JAR files:

  - prebuilt/<platform>/swt/swt.jar
  - prebuilt/common/eclipse/org.eclipse.core.commands_3.*.jar
  - prebuilt/common/eclipse/org.eclipse.equinox.common_3.*.jar
  - prebuilt/common/eclipse/org.eclipse.jface_3.*.jar


2- sdkuilib also requires the compiled swtmenubar library.

Build the swtmenubar library:
$ cd $TOP (top of Android tree)
$ . build/envsetup.sh && lunch sdk-eng
$ sdk/eclipse/scripts/create_sdkman_symlinks.sh

Define a classpath variable in Eclipse:
- Open Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables
- Create a new classpath variable named ANDROID_OUT_FRAMEWORK
- Set its folder value to <Android tree>/out/host/<platform>/framework
- Create a new classpath variable named ANDROID_SRC
- Set its folder value to <Android tree>

You might need to clean the SdkUiLib project (Project > Clean...) after
you add the new classpath variable, otherwise previous errors might not
go away automatically.

The ANDROID_SRC part should be optional. It allows you to have access to
the SwtMenuBar generic parts from the Java editor.
