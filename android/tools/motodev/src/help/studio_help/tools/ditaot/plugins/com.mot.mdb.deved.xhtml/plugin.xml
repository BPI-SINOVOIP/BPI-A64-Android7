<!-- 
     This is the plugin file that controls integration into the toolkit.
     Each item in the plugin that extends a toolkit function must be listed
     here. The only critical component is the catalog file, which must 
     extend the Toolkit's catalog in order for your files to be processed.

     If nothing else is overridden, then the toolkit will use fallback processing.
     This plugin implements overrides for XHTML (including Eclipse help) produced 
     by Motorola Dev Ed.

     NOTE: paths in this file are relative to the current directory
           (the same directory that includes this file).
