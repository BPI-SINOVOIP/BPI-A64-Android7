  <title>Validating Android applications</title>
  <shortdesc>Using the Android Application Validator, you can easily run a set of "checkers" against your application
    that look for problems that might not be immediately apparent at build or install time. The set of checks that the
    Android Application Validator runs is extensible; as new checks are developed, they will be made available for
    download.</shortdesc>
