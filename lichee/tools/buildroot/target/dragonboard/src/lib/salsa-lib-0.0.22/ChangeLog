Version 0.0.22:
	* Fix a bug of list handling in snd_async_del_handler()
	  (thanks to maarten van es).
	
Version 0.0.21:
	* Make snd_config non-NULL when snd_config_update() is called
	  so that apps can check the value.  Reset in
	  snd_config_free_global()
	* Correct hwdep path, and fix the device number handling of hwdep

Version 0.0.20:
	* Add missing _snd_pcm_hw_param_test() called by
	  snd_pcm_hw_params_test_*() API functions.
	
Version 0.0.19:
	* Fix return value of snd_ctl_subscribe_events()
	* Fix snd_card_get_index() to parse the string "x,y" correctly
	* Add snd_pcm_avail() and snd_pcm_avail_delay() to be compatible
	  with alsa-lib 1.0.18
	* Mark snd_pcm_hwsync() as deprecated, as of alsa-lib 1.0.18

Version 0.0.18:
	* Fix unclosable snd_rawmidi_open() (fix by Sam O'Connor)

Version 0.0.17:
	* Fix snd_pcm_link() calling a wrong ioctl

Version 0.0.16:
	* Fix memory leaks in error paths of PCM

version 0.0.15:
	* Add the missing snd_pcm_get_params().  snd_pcm_set_params()
	  isn't implemented (returns -ENXIO), though.
	* Add snd_pcm_htimestamp() from alsa-lib 1.0.16.
	  Also added some new PCM open bit flags.
	* Make the default alsa-lib compat-version to 1.0.16.

Version 0.0.14:
	* Fixed the memset size in snd_*_alloca() macros (more
	  exactly, __snd_alloca() macro).  What a shame.

	* Suppress "deprecated" compile warnings when built without
	  TLV support (patch by J. Scott Merritt)

Version 0.0.12:
	* Fix a typo in snd_pcm_drain().  It called DROP instead of
	  DRAIN.
	* Fix for capture -- fix the initialization of pcm->stream
	  field in snd_pcm_open()

Version 0.0.11:
	* Fix a typo in fnctl() argument in snd_pcm_open (for blocking
	  mode)
	* Fix the parse of secondary and third arguments of the device
	  name (i.e. PCM device and subdevice numbers)

Version 0.0.10:
	* Due to popular demands, make salsa-lib compile with C++ now
	  People tend to like what I don't :)
	* Rewrite memory allocation, free, copy, etc with helper macros
	* Fix missing function declarations for snd_ctl_elem_add*()
	  and snd_mixer_selem_get_enum_item_name()
	* Async is disabled as default (as written in README)
	  Fix build without async
	
Version 0.0.9:
	* Add --with-alsa-devdir configure option to specify the
	  non-standard device path (patch by Clemens Ladisch)
	* Fix some description in README

Version 0.0.8:
	* Add --disable-deprecated configure option to turn off the
	  "deprecated" attribute for non-working functions.
	* Move snd_config_update_free_global() to global.h to fix
	  compilation of aplay without conf.h.
	* Add missing declaration of snd_pcm_format_value().
	* Output hw_params and sw_params in snd_pcm_dump().
	* Fix the array size of strings for PCM mask parameters.

Version 0.0.7a:
	* Fix asoundlib.h without PCM support.
	* Fix README about async.
	* Show the determined configurations at the end of configure
	  script.

Version 0.0.7:
	* Add optional async handler support.  Disabled as default.
	* Allow to disable PCM component via configure option.
	
Version 0.0.6:
	* Fix channel_info parameter called from _snd_pcm_mmap().
	* More notes in README about known problems.
	
Version 0.0.5:
	* Fix the bug that avail_min is cleared, which screwed up poll
	  return condition

Version 0.0.4:
	* Fix the missing return from _snd_mixer_selem_get_volume_range()
	* Fix the check of stop_threshold in snd_pcm_avail_update().
	* Removed unused fields (of snd_pcm_sw_params_t) from snd_pcm_t
	  structure

Version 0.0.3:
	* Fix the stupid bug of wrong sizeof() usage in *_malloc()
	  functions.

Version 0.0.2:
	* Fix the libtool option to use -version-info instead of
	  -version-number
	* Add a brief description about cross-compiling
	
Version 0.0.1:
	* Initial release
