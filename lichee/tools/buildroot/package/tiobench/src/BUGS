- Large File Support is not working correctly in Sun Solaris
  mainly the seek test is broken.

- cpu resource counting is totally broken in Solaris after
  the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM change

- if you do short test runs (only few seconds) and if your
  data get fetched mainly from buffer cache, it might be that
  cpu% gives >100% utilization even in UP machine. This is 
  propably due to rounding/precision errors in the logic that
  sums up all the cpu times of each thread. Current fix is that
  'Don't do that!'. Few seconds tests are meaningless in any case.
