Here are some (hopefully) useful scripts to help create and
present benchmark data.

makeimages.pl takes the same parameters as tiobench.pl and uses
gnuplot to create a graph of read rate vs. thread count.

bigbench.sh is a shell script which servers as an example how to
automatize big benchmarks runs with different set of parameters
and even different programs

The more scripts, the better, and feedback on the scripts available
is always welcome.
